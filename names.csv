"nm0000002,""Lauren Bacall"",""Betty Joan Perske"",""174"",""Lauren Bacall was born Betty Joan Perske on September 16, 1924, in New York City. She was the daughter of Natalie Weinstein-Bacal, a Romanian Jewish immigrant, and William Perske, who was born in New Jersey, to Polish Jewish parents. Her family was middle-class, with her father working as a salesman and her mother as a secretary. They divorced when she was five and she rarely saw her father after that.As a school girl, she originally wanted to be a dancer, but later switched gears to head into acting. She studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York, after attending She was educated at Highland Manor, a private boarding school in Tarrytown, New York (through the generosity of wealthy uncles), and then at Julia Richman High School, which enabled her to get her feet wet in some off-Broadway productions.Out of school, she entered modeling and, because of her beauty, appeared on the cover of Harper's Bazaar, one of the most popular magazines in the US. The wife of famed director Howard Hawks spotted the picture in the publication and arranged with her husband to have Lauren take a screen test. As a result, which was entirely positive, she was given the part of Marie Browning in Acque del Sud (1944), a thriller opposite Humphrey Bogart, when she was just 19 years old. This not only set the tone for a fabulous career but also one of Hollywood's greatest love stories (she married Bogart in 1945). It was also the first of several Bogie-Bacall films.After 1945's L'agente confidenziale (1945), Lauren received second billing in Il grande sonno (1946) with Bogart. The mystery, in the role of Vivian Sternwood Rutledge, was a resounding success. Although she was making one film a year, each production would be eagerly awaited by the public. In 1947, again with her husband, Lauren starred in the thriller La fuga (1947). The film kept movie patrons on the edge of their seats. The following year, she starred with Bogart, Edward G. Robinson, and Lionel Barrymore in L'isola di corallo (1948). The crime drama was even more of a nail biter than her previous film.In 1950, Lauren starred in Le foglie d'oro (1950), a drama set in 1894. It was a film of note because she appeared without her husband - her co-star was Gary Cooper. In 1953, Lauren appeared in her first comedy as Schatze Page in Come sposare un milionario (1953). The film, with co-stars Marilyn Monroe and Betty Grable, was a smash hit all across the theaters of America.After filming La donna del destino (1957), which was released in 1957, Humphrey Bogart died on January 14 from throat cancer. Devastated at being a widow, Lauren returned to the silver screen with Dono d'amore (1958) in 1958 opposite Robert Stack. The production turned out to be a big disappointment. Undaunted, Lauren moved back to New York City and appeared in several Broadway plays to huge critical acclaim. She was enjoying acting before live audiences and the audiences in turn enjoyed her fine performances.Lauren was away from the big screen for five years, but she returned in 1964 to appear in Elettroshock (1964) and Donne v'insegno come si seduce un uomo (1964). The latter film was a comedy starring Henry Fonda and Tony Curtis. In 1966, Lauren starred in Detective's Story (1966) with Paul Newman and Julie Harris, which was one of former's signature films.Alternating her time between films and the stage, Lauren returned in 1974's Assassinio sull'Orient Express (1974). The film, based on Agatha Christie's best-selling book was a huge hit. It also garnered Ingrid Bergman her third Oscar. Actually, the huge star-studded cast helped to ensure its success. Two years later, in 1976, Lauren co-starred with John Wayne in Il pistolero (1976). The film was Wayne's last - he died from cancer in 1979.In 1981, she played an actress being stalked by a crazed admirer in Un'ombra nel buio (1981). The thriller was absolutely fascinating with Lauren in the lead role. After that production, Lauren was away from films again, this time for seven years. In the interim, she again appeared on the stages of Broadway. When she returned, it was for the filming of 1988's Mr. North (1988). After 1990's Misery non deve morire (1990) and several made for television films, Lauren appeared in 1996's Fuga dalla Casa Bianca (1996), a comedy romp with Jack Lemmon and James Garner as two ex-presidents and their escapades.Despite her age and failing health, she made a small-scale comeback in the English-language dub of Hayao Miyazaki's Il castello errante di Howl (2004) (Howl's Moving Castle, based on the young-adult novel by Diana Wynne Jones) as the Witch of the Waste, but acting endeavors for the beloved actress became increasingly rare.

Her father had an engineering degree and worked with his father in the family business. Brigitte's mother encouraged her daughter to take up music and dance, and she proved to be very adept at it. By the time she was 15, Brigitte was trying a modeling career, and found herself in the French magazine Elle. Her incredible beauty readily apparent, Brigitte next tried films. In 1952, she appeared on screen for the first time as Javotte Lemoine in Le trou normand (1952). Two more films followed and it was also the same year she married Roger Vadim (the union lasted 3Â˝ years). Capitalizing on her success in French films, Brigitte made her first American production in Atto d'amore (1953) with Kirk Douglas, but she continued to make films in France. Brigitte's explosive sexuality took the United States by storm, and the effect she had on millions of American men who had not seen a woman like her in a long, long time--if ever--was electric. Rise to the phrase sex kitten and fascination of her in the United States consisted of magazines photographs and dubbed over French films--good, bad or indifferent, her films drew audiences--mainly men--into theaters like lemmings. In 1965, she appeared as herself in the American-made Erasmo il lentigginoso (1965) with James Stewart (she only appeared in one scene). Just before she turned 40, Brigitte retired from movies after filming Colinot l'alzasottane (1973). She prefers life outside of stardom. While it enabled her to become internationally famous, it also carried with it annoyances. It was not anything for her to have fans enter her house or wander around the grounds of her home in the hopes of getting a glimpse of her or to take something that belonged to her. Paparazzi constantly hounded her with their cameras. She has been so soft-hearted that some people even have taken advantage of her generosity. After her life in the spotlight, Brigitte went on to become a leading spokesperson for animal rights and started the Foundation Brigitte Bardot dedicated solely to that cause. Her work in that realm is, perhaps, far greater than any film she could have made. Brigitte has been married to Bernard d'Ormale since 1992 and they reside in St. Tropez with their nearly 50 pets."",""September 28, 1934 inÂ Paris, France"",""28.09.1934"",""Paris, France"",,,,,""Bernard d'Ormale  (16 AugustÂ 1992 - present)Gunter Sachs  (14 JulyÂ 1966 - 3 JulyÂ 1969)Â (divorced)Jacques Charrier  (18 JuneÂ 1959 - 20 NovemberÂ 1962)Â (divorced)Â (1 child)Roger Vadim  (20 DecemberÂ 1952 - 6 DecemberÂ 1957)Â (divorced)"",""4"",""3"",""1"",""1"""
"nm0000004,""John Belushi"",""John Adam Belushi"",""170"",""John Belushi was born in Chicago, Illinois, USA, on January 24, 1949, to Agnes Demetri (Samaras) and Adam Anastos Belushi, a restaurant owner. His father was an Albanian immigrant, from QytezĂ«, and his mother was also of Albanian descent. He grew up in Wheaton, where the family moved when he was six. Though a young hellion in grade school, John became the perfect all-American boy during his high school years where he was co-captain of the Wheaton Central High School football team and was elected homecoming king his senior year. He also developed an interest in acting and appeared in the high school variety show. Encouraged by his drama teacher, John decided to put aside his plans to become a football coach to pursue a career in acting.After graduation in 1967, John performed in summer stock in rural Indiana in a variety of roles from Cardinal Wolsey in Anne of a Thousand Days to a comic detective in Ten Little Indians. In the fall of his freshman year at the University of Wisconsin at Whitewater, John changed his image into a bad-boy appearance by growing his hair long and began to have problems with discipline and structure of attending classes.Dropping out of Wisconsin, John spent the next two years at the College of DuPage, a junior college a few miles from his parents' Wheaton home, where his father began persuading him to become a partner in his restaurant, but John still preferred acting. While attending DuPage, John helped found the West Compass Players, an improv comedy troupe patterned after Chicago's famous Second City ensemble.In 1971, John made the leap to Second City itself where he performed in various on-stage comic performances with others, who included Harold Ramis and Joe Flaherty. John loved his life at Second City where he performed six nights a week, perfecting the physical gonzo style of comedy he later made famous.A year later, John and his live-in girlfriend from his high school years, Judith Belushi-Pisano, moved to New York because John had joined the cast of National Lampoon's Lemmings, an off-Broadway rock musical revue that was originally booked for a six-week run but played to full crowds for nearly 10 months.In 1973, John was hired as a writer for the syndicated National Lampoon's Radio Hour which became the National Lampoon Show in 1975. John's big break came that same year when he joined the ground-breaking TV variety series Il Saturday Night Live (1975) which made him a star. The unpredictable, aggressively physical style of humor that he began on Second City flowered on SNL.In 1978, while still working on Il Saturday Night Live (1975), John appeared in the movie Verso il sud (1978) which starred and was directed by Jack Nicholson. It was here that director John Landis noticed John and decided to cast him in his movie National Lampoon's Animal House (1978). John's minor role as the notorious, beer-swilling Bluto made it a box-office smash and the year's top grossing comedy. Despite appearing in only a dozen scenes, John's performance stole the movie, which portrays college fraternity shenanigans at a small college set in the year 1962.In 1979, John along with fellow SNL regular Dan Aykroyd quit the series to pursue movie projects. John and Dan Aykroyd appeared in minor roles in Steven Spielberg's financially unsuccessful 1941 - Allarme a Hollywood (1979) and, the following year, in John Landis' The Blues Brothers - I fratelli Blues (1980). Around this time, John's drug use began escalating. Cocaine, which was ubiquitous in show-business circles in the 1970's, became his drug of choice. After he first experimented with cocaine in the mid 1970s, John almost immediately became addicted to it. His frequent cocaine sniffing binges became a source of friction between him and Judy, whom he married in 1976.John's love for blues and soul music inspired the Blues Brothers. He and Aykroyd first appeared as Joliet Jake and Elwood Blues, a pair of white soul men dressed in black suits, skinny ties, fedora hats and Rayban sunglasses, as a warm-up act before the telecasts of Il Saturday Night Live (1975). Building on the success of their acts and the release of their album A Briefcase Full of Blues, John and Dan Aykroyd starred in the movie, which gave John a chance to act with his favorite musical heroes including Ray Charles, James Brown and Aretha Franklin.Although John's reputation for being an off-screen party animal is legendary, his generous side is less well known. Using some of his money, he bought his father a ranch outside San Diego for him to live. John helped set up some of his Chicago friends with their own businesses and even financially helped his younger brother, Jim Belushi, who followed his older brother's path to both Second City and Il Saturday Night Live (1975).In 1981, John appeared in the movie Chiamami Aquila (1981), playing a hard-nosed Chicago newspaperman who finds romance in Colorado with eagle expert Blair Brown. That same year, John and Dan Aykroyd appeared again in the movie I vicini di casa (1981), which gave them a chance to reverse roles, with John playing a straight-arrow family man whose life is turned upside down when a wild family man (Aykroyd) moves in next door.In January 1982, John began work on the screenplay for another movie to be titled Noble Rot. Also, John had checked into a bungalow at the Chateau Marmont, a popular celebrity hotel in Los Angeles. John's drug use had been steadily increasing for over a year now, which alarmed his wife and friends, but he continued to promise Judy that he would quit someday. On March 5, 1982, John Belushi was found dead in his hotel room at the age of 33. The local coroner gave the cause of death as a lethal injection of cocaine and heroin. Several years later, John's drug dealing/drug user companion during his final weeks, Cathy Smith, was tried and sentenced to three years in prison for supplying John with the drugs. Close friend James Taylor sang That Lonesome Road at a memorial service at Martha's Vineyard cemetery where John was buried."",""January 24, 1949 inÂ Chicago, Illinois, USA"",""24.01.1949"",""Chicago, Illinois, USA"",""March 5, 1982 inÂ Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, USA Â (acute cocaine and heroin intoxication)"",""05.03.1982"",""Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, USA Â "",""acute cocaine and heroin intoxication"",""Judith Belushi-Pisano  (31 DecemberÂ 1976 - 5 MarchÂ 1982)Â (his death)"",""1"",""0"",""0"",""0"""

In the miniseries Conversazioni private (1996) is the trilogy closed. Here, as in 'Den Goda Viljan' Pernilla August play his mother. Note that all three movies are not always full true biographical stories. He began his career early with a puppet theatre which he, his sister and their friends played with. But he was the manager. Strictly professional he begun writing in 1941. He had written a play called 'Kaspers dĂ¶d' (A.K.A. 'Kaspers Death') which was produced the same year. It became his entrance into the movie business as Stina Bergman (not a close relative), from the company S.F. (Swedish Filmindustry), had seen the play and thought that there must be some dramatic talent in young Ingmar. His first job was to save other more famous writers' poor scripts. Under one of that script-saving works he remembered that he had written a novel about his last year as a student. He took the novel, did the save-poor-script job first, then wrote a screenplay on his own novel. When he went back to S.F., he delivered two scripts rather than one. The script was Spasimo (1944) and was the fist Bergman screenplay that was put into film (by Alf SjĂ¶berg). It was also in that movie Bergman did his first professional film-director job. Because Alf SjĂ¶berg was busy, Bergman got the order to shoot the last sequence of the film. Ingmar Bergman is the father of Daniel Bergman, director, and Mats Bergman, actor at the Swedish Royal Dramatic Theater. Ingmar Bergman was also C.E.O. of the same theatre between 1963-1966, where he hired almost every professional actor in Sweden. In 1976 he had a famous tax problem. Bergman had trusted other people to advise him on his finances, but it turned out to be very bad advice. Bergman had to leave the country immediately, and so he went to Germany. A few years later he returned to Sweden and made his last theatrical film Fanny & Alexander (1982) (A.K.A. 'Fanny and Alexander'). In later life he retired from movie directing, but still wrote scripts for film and T.V. and directed plays at the Swedish Royal Dramatic Theatre for many years.

"nm0000006,""Ingrid Bergman"",""Ingrid Bergman"",""178"",""Ingrid Bergman was one of the greatest actresses from Hollywood's lamented Golden Era. Her natural and unpretentious beauty and her immense acting talent made her one of the most celebrated figures in the history of American cinema. Bergman is also one of the most Oscar-awarded actresses, tied with Meryl Streep, both second only to Katharine Hepburn.Ingrid Bergman was born on August 29, 1915 in Stockholm, Sweden, to a German mother, Frieda Henrietta (Adler), and a Swedish father, Justus Samuel Bergman, an artist and photographer. Her mother died when she was only two and her father died when she was 12. She went to live with an elderly uncle.The woman who would be one of the top stars in Hollywood in the 1940s had decided to become an actress after finishing her formal schooling. She had had a taste of acting at age 17 when she played an uncredited role of a girl standing in line in the Swedish film Landskamp (1932) in 1932 - not much of a beginning for a girl who would be known as Sweden's illustrious gift to Hollywood. Her parents died when she was just a girl and the uncle she lived with didn't want to stand in the way of Ingrid's dream. The next year she enrolled at the Royal Dramatic Theatre School in Stockholm but decided that stage acting was not for her. It would be three more years before she would have another chance at a film. When she did, it was more than just a bit part. The film in question was Munkbrogreven (1935), where she had a speaking part as Elsa Edlund. After several films that year that established her as a class actress, Ingrid appeared in La sposa scomparsa (1936) as Anita Hoffman. Luckily for her, American producer David O. Selznick saw it and sent a representative from Selznick International Pictures to gain rights to the story and have Ingrid signed to a contract. Once signed, she came to California and starred in United Artists' 1939 remake of her 1936 film, Intermezzo (1939), reprising her original role. The film was a hit and so was Ingrid.Her beauty was unlike anything the movie industry had seen before and her acting was superb. Hollywood was about to find out that they had the most versatile actress the industry had ever seen. Here was a woman who truly cared about the craft she represented. The public fell in love with her. Ingrid was under contract to go back to Sweden to film Solo una notte (1939) in 1939 and Juninatten (1940) in 1940. Back in the US she appeared in three films, all well-received. She made only one film in 1942, but it was the classic Casablanca (1942) opposite Humphrey Bogart.Ingrid was choosing her roles well. In 1943 she was nominated for an Academy Award for her role in Per chi suona la campana (1943), the only film she made that year. The critics and public didn't forget her when she made Angoscia (1944) the following year--her role of Paula Alquist got her the Oscar for Best Actress. In 1945 Ingrid played in Io ti salverĂ˛ (1945), Saratoga (1945) and Le campane di Santa Maria (1945), for which she received her third Oscar nomination for her role of Sister Benedict. She made no films in 1947, but bounced back with a fourth nomination for Giovanna d'Arco (1948). In 1949 she went to Italy to film Stromboli (Terra di Dio) (1950), directed by Roberto Rossellini. She fell in love with him and left her husband, Dr. Peter Lindstrom, and daughter, Pia LindstrĂ¶m. America's moral guardians in the press and the pulpits were outraged. She was pregnant and decided to remain in Italy, where her son was born. In 1952 Ingrid had twins, Isotta and Isabella Rossellini, who became an outstanding actress in her own right, as did Pia.Ingrid continued to make films in Italy and finally returned to Hollywood in 1956 in the title role in Anastasia (1956), which was filmed in England. For this she won her second Academy Award. She had scarcely missed a beat. Ingrid continued to bounce between Europe and the US making movies, and fine ones at that. A film with Ingrid Bergman was sure to be a quality production. In her final big-screen performance in 1978's Sinfonia d'autunno (1978) she had her final Academy Award nomination. Though she didn't win, many felt it was the most sterling performance of her career. Ingrid retired, but not before she gave an outstanding performance in the mini-series Una donna di nome Golda (1982), a film about Israeli prime minister Golda Meir. For this she won an Emmy Award as Best Actress, but, unfortunately, she did not live to see the fruits of her labor.Ingrid died from cancer on August 29, 1982, her 67th birthday, in London, England."",""August 29, 1915 inÂ Stockholm, Sweden"",""29.08.1915"",""Stockholm, Sweden"",""August 29, 1982 inÂ Chelsea, London, England, UK Â (lymphoma complications following a breast cancer operation)"",""29.08.1982"",""Chelsea, London, England, UK Â "",""lymphoma complications following a breast cancer operation"",""Lars Schmidt  (21 DecemberÂ 1958 - 1978)Â (divorced)Roberto Rossellini  (24 MayÂ 1950 - 7 NovemberÂ 1957)Â (divorced)Â (3 children)Dr. Petter Aron LindstrĂ¶m  (10 JulyÂ 1937 - 9 FebruaryÂ 1950)Â (divorced)Â (1 child)"",""3"",""3"",""2"",""4"""

Bogart was educated at Trinity School, NYC, and was sent to Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, in preparation for medical studies at Yale. He was expelled from Phillips and joined the U.S. Naval Reserve. From 1920 to 1922, he managed a stage company owned by family friend William A. Brady (the father of actress Alice Brady), performing a variety of tasks at Brady's film studio in New York. He then began regular stage performances. Alexander Woollcott described his acting in a 1922 play as inadequate. In 1930, he gained a contract with Fox, his feature film debut in a ten-minute short, Broadway's Like That (1930), co-starring Ruth Etting and Joan Blondell. Fox released him after two years. After five years of stage and minor film roles, he had his breakthrough role in La foresta pietrificata (1936) from Warner Bros. He won the part over Edward G. Robinson only after the star, Leslie Howard, threatened Warner Bros. that he would quit unless Bogart was given the key role of Duke Mantee, which he had played in the Broadway production with Howard. The film was a major success and led to a long-term contract with Warner Bros. From 1936 to 1940, Bogart appeared in 28 films, usually as a gangster, twice in Westerns and even a horror film. His landmark year was 1941 (often capitalizing on parts George Raft had stupidly rejected) with roles in classics such as Una pallottola per Roy (1941) and as Sam Spade in one of his most fondly remembered films, Il mistero del falco (1941). These were followed by Casablanca (1942), Il grande sonno (1946), and L'isola di corallo (1948). Bogart, despite his erratic education, was incredibly well-read and he favored writers and intellectuals within his small circle of friends. In 1947, he joined wife Lauren Bacall and other actors protesting the House Un-American Activities Committee witch hunts. He also formed his own production company, and the next year made Il tesoro della Sierra Madre (1948). Bogie won the best actor Academy Award for La regina d'Africa (1951) and was nominated for Casablanca (1942) and as Captain Queeg in L'ammutinamento del Caine (1954), a film made when he was already seriously ill.

"nm0000009,""Richard Burton"",""Richard Walter Jenkins"",""178"",""Probably best-remembered for his turbulent personal life with Elizabeth Taylor (whom he married twice), Richard Burton was nonetheless also regarded as an often brilliant British actor of the post-WWII period.Burton was born Richard Walter Jenkins in 1925 into a Welsh (Cymraeg)-speaking family in Pontrhydyfen to Edith Maude (Thomas) and Richard Walter Jenkins, a coal miner. The twelfth of thirteen children, his mother died while he was a toddler and his father later abandoned the family, leaving him to be raised by an elder sister, Cecilia. An avid fan of Shakespeare, poetry and reading, he once said home is where the books are. He received a scholarship to Oxford University to study acting and made his first stage appearance in 1944.His first film appearances were in routine British movies such as The Last Days of Dolwyn (1949), Tempesta a Liverpool (1950) and La quinta offensiva (1951). Then he started to appear in Hollywood movies such as Mia cugina Rachele (1952), La tunica (1953) and Alessandro il grande (1956), added to this he was also spending considerable time in stage productions, both in the UK and USA, often to splendid reviews. The late 1950s was an exciting and inventive time in UK cinema, often referred to as the British New Wave, and Burton was right in the thick of things, and showcased a sensational performance in I giovani arrabbiati (1959). He also appeared with a cavalcade of international stars in the World War II magnum opus Il giorno piĂą lungo (1962), and then onto arguably his most notorious role as that of Marc Antony opposite Elizabeth Taylor in the hugely expensive Cleopatra (1963). This was, of course, the film that kick-started their fiery and passionate romance (plus two marriages), and the two of them appeared in several productions over the next few years including International Hotel (1963), Castelli di sabbia (1965), the dynamic Chi ha paura di Virginia Woolf? (1966) and La bisbetica domata (1967), as well as box office flops like I commedianti (1967). Burton did better when he was off on his own giving higher caliber performances, such as those in Becket e il suo re (1964), the film adaptation of the Tennessee Williams play La notte dell'iguana (1964), the brilliant espionage thriller La spia che venne dal freddo (1965) and alongside Clint Eastwood in the World War II action adventure film Dove osano le aquile (1968).His audience appeal began to decline somewhat by the end of the 1960s as fans turned to younger, more virile male stars, however Burton was superb in Anna dei mille giorni (1969) as King Henry VIII, he put on a reasonable show in the boring Attacco a Rommel (1971), was over the top in the awful Il mascalzone (1971), gave sleepwalking performances in Una faccia di c... (1972) and BarbablĂą (1972), and was wildly miscast in the ludicrous L'assassinio di Trotsky (1972).By the early 1970s, quality male lead roles were definitely going to other stars, and Burton found himself appearing in some movies of dubious quality, just to pay the bills and support family, including Divorzia lui divorzia lei (1973) (his last on-screen appearance with Taylor), L'uomo del clan (1974), Breve incontro (1974), Jackpot (1974) (which was never completed) and L'esorcista II - L'eretico (1977). However, he won another Oscar nomination for his excellent performance as a concerned psychiatrist in Equus (1977). He appeared with fellow acting icons Richard Harris and Roger Moore in I 4 dell'oca selvaggia (1978) about mercenaries in South Africa. While the film had a modest initial run, over the past thirty-five years it has picked up quite a cult following. His final performances were as the wily inquisitor O'Brien in the most recent film version of George Orwell's dystopian Orwell 1984 (1984), in which he won good reviews, and in the TV mini series Ellis Island (1984). He passed away on August 5, 1984 in Celigny, Switzerland from a cerebral hemorrhage."",""November 10, 1925 inÂ Pontrhydyfen, Wales, UK"",""10.11.1925"",""Pontrhydyfen, Wales, UK"",""August 5, 1984 inÂ CĂ©ligny, Geneva, Switzerland Â (cerebral hemorrhage)"",""05.08.1984"",""CĂ©ligny, Geneva, Switzerland Â "",""cerebral hemorrhage"",""Sally Burton  (3 JulyÂ 1983 - 5 AugustÂ 1984)Â (his death)Susan Hunt  (21 AugustÂ 1976 - 27 FebruaryÂ 1983)Â (divorced)Elizabeth Taylor  (10 OctoberÂ 1975 - 29 JulyÂ 1976)Â (divorced)Elizabeth Taylor  (15 MarchÂ 1964 - 26 JuneÂ 1974)Â (divorced)Â (1 child)Sybil Williams  (5 FebruaryÂ 1949 - 5 DecemberÂ 1963)Â (divorced)Â (2 children)"",""5"",""4"",""2"",""3"""

"nm0000012,""Bette Davis"",""Ruth Elizabeth Davis"",""160"",""Ruth Elizabeth Davis was born April 5, 1908, in Lowell, Massachusetts, to Ruth Augusta (Favor) and Harlow Morrell Davis, a patent attorney. Her parents divorced when she was 10. She and her sister were raised by their mother. Her early interest was dance. To Bette, dancers led a glamorous life, but then she discovered the stage, and gave up dancing for acting. To her, it presented much more of a challenge.After graduation from Cushing Academy, she was refused admittance to Eva Le Gallienne's Manhattan Civic Repertory. She enrolled in John Murray Anderson's Dramatic School and was the star pupil. She was in the off-Broadway play The Earth Between (1923), and her Broadway debut in 1929 was in Broken Dishes. She also appeared in Solid South. Late in 1930, she was hired by Universal, where she made her first film, called Way Back Home (1931). When she arrived in Hollywood, the studio representative who went to meet her train left without her because he could find no one who looked like a movie star. An official at Universal complained she had as much sex appeal as Slim Summerville and her performance in The Bad Sister (1931) didn't impress.In 1932, she signed a seven-year deal with Warner Brothers Pictures. Her first film with them was Il richiamo dei figli (1931). She became a star after her appearance in The Man Who Played God (1932), known as the actress that could play a variety of very strong and complex roles. More fairly successful movies followed, but it was the role of Mildred Rogers in RKO's Schiavo d'amore (1934) that would give Bette major acclaim from the film critics. She had a significant number of write-in votes for the Best Actress Oscar, but didn't win. Warner Bros. felt their seven-year deal with Bette was more than justified. They had a genuine star on their hands. With this success under her belt, she began pushing for stronger and more meaningful roles. In 1935, she received her first Oscar for her role in Paura d'amare (1935) as Joyce Heath.In 1936, she was suspended without pay for turning down a role that she deemed unworthy of her talent. She went to England, where she had planned to make movies, but was stopped by Warner Bros. because she was still under contract to them. They did not want her to work anywhere. Although she sued to get out of her contract, she lost. Still, they began to take her more seriously after that.Returning after losing her lawsuit, her roles improved dramatically. In 1938, Bette received a second Academy Award nomination for her work in Figlia del vento (1938) opposite the soon-to-be-legendary Henry Fonda. The only role she didn't get that she wanted was Scarlett O'Hara in Via col vento (1939). Warners wouldn't loan her to David O. Selznick unless he hired Errol Flynn to play Rhett Butler, which both Selznick and Davis thought was a terrible choice. It was rumored she had numerous affairs, among them George Brent and William Wyler, and she was married four times, three of which ended in divorce. She admitted her career always came first.She made many successful films in the 1940s, but each picture was weaker than the last and by the time her Warner Brothers contract had ended in 1949, she had been reduced to appearing in such films as the unintentionally hilarious Peccato (1949). She made a huge comeback in 1950 when she replaced an ill Claudette Colbert in, and received an Oscar nomination for, Eva contro Eva (1950). She worked in films through the 1950s, but her career eventually came to a standstill, and in 1961 she placed a now famous Job Wanted ad in the trade papers.She received an Oscar nomination for her role as a demented former child star in Che fine ha fatto Baby Jane? (1962). This brought about a new round of super-stardom for generations of fans who were not familiar with her work. Two years later, she starred in Piano... piano, dolce Carlotta (1964). Bette was married four times.In 1977 she received the AFI's Lifetime Achievement Award and in 1979 she won a Best Actress Emmy for L'abisso - Storia di una madre e di una figlia (1979). In 1977-78 she moved from Connecticut to Los Angeles and filmed a pilot for the series Hotel (1983), which she called Brothel. She refused to do the TV series and suffered a stroke during this time.Her last marriage, to actor Gary Merrill, lasted ten years, longer than any of the previous three. In 1985, her daughter Barbara Davis (B.D.) Hyman published a scandalous book about Bette called My Mother's Keeper. Bette worked in the later 1980s in films and TV, even though a stroke had impaired her appearance and mobility. She wrote a book, This 'N That, during her recovery from the stroke. Her last book was Bette Davis, The Lonely Life, issued in paperback in 1990. It included an update from 1962 to 1989. She wrote the last chapter in San Sebastian, Spain.Sadly, Bette Davis died on October 6, 1989, of metastasized breast cancer, in Neuilly-sur-Seine, Hauts-de-Seine, France.

"nm0000013,""Doris Day"",""Doris Mary Ann Kappelhoff"",""170"",""One of America's most prolific actresses was born Doris Mary Ann Kappelhoff on April 3, 1922, in Cincinnati, Ohio, to Alma Sophia (Welz), a housewife, and William Joseph Kappelhoff, a music teacher and choir master. Her grandparents were all German immigrants. She had two brothers, Richard, who died before she was born and Paul, a few years older.Her parents divorced while she was still a child, and she lived with her mother. Like most little girls, Doris liked to dance. At fourteen, she formed a dance act with a boy, Jerry Doherty, and they won $500 in a local talent contest. She and Jerry took a brief trip to Hollywood to test the waters. They felt they could succeed, so she and Jerry returned to Cincinnati with the intention of packing and making a permanent move to Hollywood. Tragically, the night before she was to move to Hollywood, she was injured riding in a car hit by a train, ending the possibility of a dancing career.It was a terrible setback, but after taking singing lessons she found a new vocation, and at age 17, she began touring with the Les Brown Band. She met trombonist Al Jorden, whom she married in 1941. Jorden was prone to violence and they divorced after two years, not long after the birth of their son Terry. In 1946, Doris married George Weidler, but this union lasted less than a year. Day's agent talked her into taking a screen test at Warner Bros. The executives there liked what they saw and signed her to a contract (her early credits are often confused with those of another actress named Doris Day, who appeared mainly in B westerns in the 1930s and 1940s).Her first starring movie role was in Amore sotto coperta (1948). The next year, she made two more films, Musica per i tuoi sogni (1949) and L'amore non puĂ˛ attendere (1949). Audiences took to her beauty, terrific singing voice and bubbly personality, and she turned in fine performances in the movies she made (in addition to several hit records). She made three films for Warner Bros. in 1950 and five more in 1951. In that year, she met and married Martin Melcher, who adopted her young son Terry, who later grew up to become Terry Melcher, a successful record producer.In 1953, Doris starred in Non sparare, baciami! (1953), which was a major hit, and several more followed: Un pizzico di fortuna (1954), Amami o lasciami (1955), L'uomo che sapeva troppo (1956) and what is probably her best-known film, Il letto racconta (1959). She began to slow down her filmmaking pace in the 1960s, even though she started out the decade with a hit, Non mangiate le margherite (1960).In 1958, her brother Paul died. Around this time, her husband, who had also taken charge of her career, had made deals for her to star in films she didn't really care about, which led to a bout with exhaustion. The 1960s weren't to be a repeat of the previous busy decade. She didn't make as many films as she had in that decade, but the ones she did make were successful: Non disturbate (1965), La mia spia di mezzanotte (1966), Che cosa hai fatto quando siamo rimasti al buio? (1968) and C'Ă¨ un uomo nel letto di mamma (1968). Martin Melcher died in 1968, and Doris never made another film, but she had been signed by Melcher to do her own TV series, The Doris Day Show (1968). That show, like her movies, was successful, lasting until 1973. After her series went off the air, she made only occasional TV appearances.By the time Martin Melcher died, Doris discovered she was millions of dollars in debt. She learned that Melcher had squandered virtually all of her considerable earnings, but she was eventually awarded $22 million by the courts in a case against a man that Melcher had unwisely let invest her money. She married for the fourth time in 1976 and since her divorce in 1980 has devoted her life to animals.Doris was a passionate animal rights activist. She ran Doris Day Animal League in Carmel, California, which advocates homes and proper care of household pets.Doris died on May 13, 2019, in Carmel Valley Village, California.

"nm0000014,""Olivia de Havilland"",""Olivia Mary de Havilland"",""163"",""Olivia Mary de Havilland was born July 1, 1916, in Tokyo, Japan, to British parents, Lilian Augusta (Ruse), a former actress, and Walter Augustus de Havilland, an English professor and patent attorney. Her sister, Joan, later to become famous as Joan Fontaine, was born the following year. Her surname comes from her paternal grandfather, whose family was from Guernsey in the Channel Islands. Her parents divorced when Olivia was just three years old, and she moved with her mother and sister to Saratoga, California. After graduating from high school, where she fell prey to the acting bug, Olivia enrolled in Mills College in Oakland. It was while she was at Mills that she participated in the school play A Midsummer Night's Dream and was spotted by Max Reinhardt. She so impressed Reinhardt that he picked her up for both his stage version and, later, the Warner Bros. film version in 1935.She again was so impressive that Warner executives signed her to a seven-year contract. No sooner had the ink dried on the contract than Olivia appeared in three more films: Colpo proibito (1935), Alibi Ike (1935) and Capitan Blood (1935), the latter with the man with whom her career would be most closely identified, heartthrob Errol Flynn. He and Olivia starred together in eight films during their careers. In 1939 Warner Bros. loaned her to David O. Selznick for the classic Via col vento (1939). Playing sweet Melanie Hamilton, Olivia received her first nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, only to lose out to one of her co-stars in the film, Hattie McDaniel.After GWTW, Olivia returned to Warner Bros. and continued to churn out films. In 1941 she played Emmy Brown in La porta d'oro (1941), which resulted in her second Oscar nomination, this time for Best Actress. Again she lost, this time to her sister Joan for her role in Il sospetto (1941). After that strong showing, Olivia now demanded better, more substantial roles than the sweet young thing slot into which Warners had been fitting her. The studio responded by placing her on a six-month suspension, all of the studios at the time operating under the policy that players were nothing more than property to do with as they saw fit. As if that weren't bad enough, when her contract with Warners was up, she was told that she would have to make up the time lost because of the suspension.Irate, she sued the studio, and for the length of the court battle she didn't appear in a single film. The result, however, was worth it. In a landmark decision, the court said not only that Olivia did not have to make up the time, but that all performers were to be limited to a seven-year contract that would include any suspensions handed down. This became known as the de Havilland decision no longer could studios treat their performers as chattel. Returning to screen in 1946, Olivia made up for lost time by appearing in four films, one of which finally won her the Oscar that had so long eluded her. It was A ciascuno il suo destino (1946), in which she played Josephine Norris to the delight of critics and audiences alike. Olivia was the strongest performer in Hollywood for the balance of the 1940s.In 1948 she turned in another strong showing in La fossa dei serpenti (1948) as Virginia Cunningham, a woman suffering a mental breakdown. The end result was another Oscar nomination for Best Actress, but she lost to Jane Wyman in Johnny Belinda (1948). As in the two previous years, she made only one film in 1949, but she again won a nomination and the Academy Award for Best Actress for L'ereditiera (1949). After a three-year hiatus, Olivia returned to star in Mia cugina Rachele (1952). From that point on, she made few appearances on the screen but was seen on Broadway and in some television shows. Her last screen appearance was in The Fifth Musketeer (1979), and her last career appearance was in the TV movie The Woman He Loved (1988).Her turbulent relationship with her only sibling, Joan Fontaine, was press fodder for many decades, with the two reported as not speaking and permanently estranged since the death of their mother in 1975, when Joan claimed she had not been invited to the memorial service which event she claimed she only managed to hold off until she could arrive by threatening to go public. Joan also wrote in her memoir that her elder sister had been physically, psychologically and emotionally abusive when they were young. And the iconic photo of Joan with her hand outstretched to congratulate Olivia backstage after the latter's first Oscar win and Olivia ignoring it because she was peeved by a comment Joan had made about Olivia's new husband, Marcus Goodrich, remained part of Hollywood lore for many years.Nonetheless, late in life, Fontaine gave an interview in which she serenely denied any and all claims of an estrangement from her sister. When a reporter asked Joan if she and Olivia were friends, she replied, Of course! The reporter responded that rumors to the contrary must have been sensationalism and she replied, Oh, right - they have to. Two nice girls liking each other isn't copy. Asked if she and Olivia were in communication and spoke to each other, Joan replied Absolutely. When asked if there ever had been a time when the two did not get along to the point where they wouldn't speak with one another, Joan replied, again, Never. Never. There is not a word of truth about that. When asked why people believe it, she replied Oh, I have no idea. It's just something to say ... Oh, it's terrible. When asked if she had seen Olivia over the years, she replied, I've seen her in Paris. And she came to my apartment in New York often. The reporter stated that all this was a nice thing to hear. Joan then stated, Let me just say, Olivia and I have never had a quarrel. We have never had any dissatisfaction. We have never had hard words. And all this is press. Joan died in 2013.During the hoopla surrounding the 50th anniversary of GWTW in 1989, Olivia graciously declined requests for all interviews as the last of the four main stars. She enjoyed a quiet retirement in Paris, France, where she resided for many decades, and where she died on 26 July, 2020, at the age of 104.She was the last surviving cast member of Gone with the Wind, and one of the longest-lived actors of Hollywood's Golden Age, along with Kirk Douglas, who had died earlier the same year at 103."",""July 1, 1916 inÂ Tokyo, Japan"",""01.07.1916"",""Tokyo, Japan"",""July 26, 2020 inÂ Paris, France Â (natural causes)"",""26.07.2020"",""Paris, France Â "",""natural causes"",""Pierre Galante  (2 AprilÂ 1955 - 30 AprilÂ 1979)Â (divorced)Â (1 child)Marcus Goodrich  (26 AugustÂ 1946 - 28 AugustÂ 1953)Â (divorced)Â (1 child)"",""2"",""2"",""2"",""2"""

After grade school, he moved to New York to pursue his dream of acting. He received rave reviews for his work as the blackmailing Arab boy in the New York production of Gide's The Immoralist, good enough to earn him a trip to Hollywood. His early film efforts were strictly small roles: a sailor in the Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis overly frantic musical comedy Attente ai marinai!

In the Elia Kazan production of John Steinbeck's La valle dell'Eden (1955) he played Cal Trask, the bad brother who could not force affection from his stiff-necked father. His true starring role, the one which fixed his image forever in American culture, was that of the brooding red-jacketed teenager Jim Stark in Nicholas Ray's GioventĂą bruciata (1955). George Stevens' filming of Edna Ferber's Il gigante (1956), in which he played the non-conforming cowhand Jett Rink who strikes it rich when he discovers oil, was just coming to a close when Dean, driving his Porsche Spyder race car, collided with another car while on the road near Cholame, California on September 30, 1955.

She entered the cabaret scene in 1920s Germany, first as a spectator then as a cabaret singer. In 1924, she married and, although she and Rudolf Sieber lived together only 5 years, they remained married until his death. She was in over a dozen silent films in increasingly important roles. In 1929, she was seen in a Berlin cabaret by Josef von Sternberg and, after a screen test, captured the role of the cabaret singer in L'angelo azzurro (1930) (and became von Sternberg's lover). With the success of this film, von Sternberg immediately took her to Hollywood, introducing her to the world in Marocco (1930), and signing an agreement to produce all her films. A series of successes followed, and Marlene became the highest paid actress of her time, but her later films in the mid-part of the decade were critical and popular failures. She returned to Europe at the end of the decade, with a series of affairs with former leading men (she had a reputation of romancing her co-stars), as well as other prominent artistic figures. In 1939, an offer came to star with James Stewart in a western and, after initial hesitation, she accepted. The film was Partita d'azzardo (1939) - the siren of film could also be a comedienne and a remarkable comeback was reality. She toured extensively for the allied effort in WW II (she had become a United States citizen) and, after the war, limited her cinematic life. But a new career as a singer and performer appeared, with reviews and shows in Las Vegas, touring theatricals, and even Broadway.

On the insistence of ex-classmate Lauren Bacall, movie producer Hal B. Wallis screen-tested Douglas and cast him in the lead role in Lo strano amore di Marta Ivers (1946). His performance received rave reviews and further work quickly followed, including an appearance in the low-key drama Le vie della cittĂ  (1947), the first time he worked alongside fellow future screen legend Burt Lancaster. Such was the strong chemistry between the two that they appeared in seven films together, including the dynamic western Sfida all'O.K. Corral (1957), the John Frankenheimer political thriller Sette giorni a maggio (1964) and their final pairing in the gangster comedy Due tipi incorreggibili (1986). Douglas once said about his good friend: I've finally gotten away from Burt Lancaster. My luck has changed for the better. I've got nice-looking girls in my films now..After appearing in I Walk Alone, Douglas scored his first Oscar nomination playing the untrustworthy and opportunistic boxer Midge Kelly in the gripping Il grande campione (1949). The quality of his work continued to garner the attention of critics and he was again nominated for Oscars for his role as a film producer in Il bruto e la bella (1952) and as tortured painter Vincent van Gogh in Brama di vivere (1956), both directed by Vincente Minnelli. In 1955, Douglas launched his own production company, Bryna Productions, the company behind two pivotal film roles in his career. The first was as French army officer Col. Dax in director Stanley Kubrick's brilliant anti-war epic Orizzonti di gloria (1957). Douglas reunited with Kubrick for yet another epic, the magnificent Spartacus (1960). The film also marked a key turning point in the life of screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, who had been blacklisted during the McCarthy Red Scare hysteria in the 1950s. At Douglas' insistence, Trumbo was given on-screen credit for his contributions, which began the dissolution of the infamous blacklisting policies begun almost a decade previously that had destroyed so many careers and lives.Douglas remained busy throughout the 1960s, starring in many films. He played a rebellious modern-day cowboy in Solo sotto le stelle (1962), acted alongside John Wayne in the World War II story Prima vittoria (1965), again with The Duke in a drama about the Israeli fight for independence, Combattenti della notte (1966), and once more with Wayne in the tongue-in-cheek western Carovana di fuoco (1967). Additionally in 1963, he starred in an onstage production of Ken Kesey's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, but despite his keen interest, no Hollywood studio could be convinced to bring the story to the screen. However, the rights remained with the Douglas clan, and Kirk's talented son Michael Douglas finally filmed the tale in 1975, starring Jack Nicholson. Into the 1970s, Douglas wasn't as busy as previous years however, he starred in some unusual vehicles, including alongside a young Arnold Schwarzenegger in the loopy western comedy Jack del Cactus (1979), then with Farrah Fawcett in the sci-fi thriller Saturn 3 (1980) and then he traveled to Australia for the horse opera/drama L'uomo del fiume nevoso (1982).Unknown to many, Kirk has long been involved in humanitarian causes and has been a Goodwill Ambassador for the US State Department since 1963. His efforts were rewarded with the Presidential Medal of Freedom (1981), and with the Jefferson Award (1983). Furthermore, the French honored him with the Chevalier of the Legion of Honor. More recognition followed for his work with the American Cinema Award (1987), the German Golden Kamera Award (1987), The National Board of Reviews Career Achievement Award (1989), an honorary Academy Award (1995), Recipient of the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award (1999) and the UCLA Medal of Honor (2002). Despite a helicopter crash and a stroke suffered in the 1990s, he remained active and continued to appear in front of the camera. Until his passing on February 5 2020 at the age of 103, he and Olivia de Havilland were the last surviving major stars from the Golden Years of Hollywood."",""December 9, 1916 inÂ Amsterdam, New York, USA"",""09.12.1916"",""Amsterdam, New York, USA"",""February 5, 2020 inÂ Los Angeles, California, USA Â (natural causes)"",""05.02.2020"",""Los Angeles, California, USA Â "",""natural causes"",""Anne Douglas  (29 MayÂ 1954 - 5 FebruaryÂ 2020)Â (his death)Â (2 children)Diana Douglas  (2 NovemberÂ 1943 - 23 FebruaryÂ 1951)Â (divorced)Â (2 children)"",""2"",""1"",""2"",""4"""

Life and dreams were raw material for his films. His native Rimini and characters like Saraghina (the devil herself said the priests who ran his school) - and the Gambettola farmhouse of his paternal grandmother would be remembered in several films. His traveling salesman father Urbano Fellini showed up in La dolce vita (1960) and 8Â˝ (1963). His mother Ida Barbiani was from Rome and accompanied him there in 1939. He enrolled in the University of Rome. Intrigued by the image of reporters in American films, he tried out the real life role of journalist and caught the attention of several editors with his caricatures and cartoons and then started submitting articles. Several articles were recycled into a radio series about newlyweds Cico and Pallina. Pallina was played by acting student Giulietta Masina, who became his real life wife from October 30, 1943, until his death half a century later. The young Fellini loved vaudeville and was befriended in 1940 by leading comedian Aldo Fabrizi. Roberto Rossellini wanted Fabrizi to play Don Pietro in Roma cittĂ  aperta (1945) and made the contact through Fellini. Fellini worked on that film's script and is on the credits for Rosselini's PaisĂ  (1946). On that film he wandered into the editing room, started observing how Italian films were made (a lot like the old silent films with an emphasis on visual effects, dialogue dubbed in later).

Her father was a British patent attorney with a lucrative practice in Japan, but due to Joan and older sister Olivia de Havilland's recurring ailments the family moved to California in the hopes of improving their health. Mrs. de Havilland and the two girls settled in Saratoga while their father went back to his practice in Japan. Joan's parents did not get along well and divorced soon afterward. Mrs. de Havilland had a desire to be an actress but her dreams were curtailed when she married, but now she hoped to pass on her dream to Olivia and Joan. While Olivia pursued a stage career, Joan went back to Tokyo, where she attended the American School. In 1934 she came back to California, where her sister was already making a name for herself on the stage. Joan likewise joined a theater group in San Jose and then Los Angeles to try her luck there. After moving to L.A., Joan adopted the name of Joan Burfield because she didn't want to infringe upon Olivia, who was using the family surname. She tested at MGM and gained a small role in Non piĂą signore (1935), but she was scarcely noticed and Joan was idle for a year and a half. During this time she roomed with Olivia, who was having much more success in films. In 1937, this time calling herself Joan Fontaine, she landed a better role as Trudy Olson in You Can't Beat Love (1937) and then an uncredited part in Dolce inganno (1937). Although the next two years saw her in better roles, she still yearned for something better. In 1940 she garnered her first Academy Award nomination for Rebecca - La prima moglie (1940). Although she thought she should have won, (she lost out to Ginger Rogers in Kitty Foyle, ragazza innamorata (1940)), she was now an established member of the Hollywood set. She would again be Oscar-nominated for her role as Lina McLaidlaw Aysgarth in Il sospetto (1941), and this time she won. Joan was making one film a year but choosing her roles well. In 1942 she starred in the well-received Sono un disertore (1942). The following year she appeared in Il fiore che non colsi (1943). Once again she was nominated for the Oscar, she lost out to Jennifer Jones in Bernadette (1943). By now it was safe to say she was more famous than her older sister and more fine films followed. In 1948, she accepted second billing to Bing Crosby in Il valzer dell'imperatore (1948). Joan took the year of 1949 off before coming back in 1950 with Accadde in settembre (1950) and La seduttrice (1950). In 1951 she starred in Paramount's La mia donna Ă¨ un angelo (1951), which turned out badly for both her and the studio and more weak productions followed. Absent from the big screen for a while, she took parts in television and dinner theaters. She also starred in many well-produced Broadway plays such as Forty Carats and The Lion in Winter. Her last appearance on the big screen was Creatura del diavolo (1966) and her final appearance before the cameras was Good King Wenceslas (1994). She is, without a doubt, a lasting movie icon."",""October 22, 1917 inÂ Tokyo, Japan"",""22.10.1917"",""Tokyo, Japan"",""December 15, 2013 inÂ Carmel, California, USA Â (natural causes)"",""15.12.2013"",""Carmel, California, USA Â "",""natural causes"",""Alfred Wright, Jr.  (27 JanuaryÂ 1964 - 1969)Â (divorced)Collier Young  (12 NovemberÂ 1952 - 3 JanuaryÂ 1961)Â (divorced)William Dozier  (2 MayÂ 1946 - 25 JanuaryÂ 1951)Â (divorced)Â (1 child)Brian Aherne  (20 AugustÂ 1939 - 14 JuneÂ 1945)Â (divorced)"",""4"",""4"",""1"",""1"""

He was of German, Irish, and Swiss-German descent. When he was seven months old, his mother died, and his father sent him to live with his maternal aunt and uncle in Pennsylvania, where he stayed until he was two. His father then returned to take him back to Cadiz. At 16, he quit high school, went to work in an Akron, Ohio, tire factory, and decided to become an actor after seeing the play The Bird of Paradise. He toured in stock companies, worked oil fields and sold ties. On December 13, 1924, he married Josephine Dillon, his acting coach and 15 years his senior. Around that time, they moved to Hollywood, so that Clark could concentrate on his acting career. In April 1930, they divorced and a year later, he married Maria Langham (a.k.a. Maria Franklin Gable), also about 17 years older than him.While Gable acted on stage, he became a lifelong friend of Lionel Barrymore. After several failed screen tests (for Barrymore and Darryl F. Zanuck), Gable was signed in 1930 by MGM's Irving Thalberg. He had a small part in The Painted Desert (1931) with starred William Boyd. Joan Crawford asked for him as co-star in La via del male (1931) and the public loved him manhandling Norma Shearer in Io amo (1931) the same year. His unshaven lovemaking with bra-less Jean Harlow in Lo schiaffo (1932) made him MGM's most important star.His acting career then flourished. At one point, he refused an assignment, and the studio punished him by loaning him out to (at the time) low-rent Columbia Pictures, which put him in Frank Capra's Accadde una notte (1934), which won him an Academy Award for his performance. The next year saw a starring role in Il richiamo della foresta (1935) with Loretta Young, with whom he had an affair (resulting in the birth of a daughter, Judy Lewis). He returned to far more substantial roles at MGM, such as Fletcher Christian in La tragedia del Bounty (1935) and Rhett Butler in Via col vento (1939).After divorcing Maria Langham, in March 1939 Clark married Carole Lombard, but tragedy struck in January 1942 when the plane in which Carole and her mother were flying crashed into Table Rock Mountain, Nevada, killing them both. A grief-stricken Gable joined the US Army Air Force and was off the screen for three years, flying combat missions in Europe. When he returned the studio regarded his salary as excessive and did not renew his contract. He freelanced, but his films didn't do well at the box office. He married Sylvia Ashley, the widow of Douglas Fairbanks, in 1949. Unfortunately this marriage was short-lived and they divorced in 1952. In July 1955 he married a former sweetheart, Kathleen Williams Spreckles (a.k.a. Kay Williams) and became stepfather to her two children, Joan and Adolph (Bunker) Spreckels III.On November 16, 1959, Gable became a grandfather when Judy Lewis, his daughter with Loretta Young, gave birth to a daughter, Maria. In 1960, Gable's wife Kay discovered that she was expecting their first child. In early November 1960, he had just completed filming Gli spostati (1961), when he suffered a heart attack, and died later that month, on November 16, 1960. Gable was buried shortly afterwards in the shrine that he had built for Carole Lombard and her mother when they died, at Forest Lawn Cemetery.In March 1961, Kay Gable gave birth to a boy, whom she named John Clark Gable after his father."",""February 1, 1901 inÂ Cadiz, Ohio, USA"",""01.02.1901"",""Cadiz, Ohio, USA"",""November 16, 1960 inÂ Los Angeles, California, USA Â (coronary thrombosis)"",""16.11.1960"",""Los Angeles, California, USA Â "",""coronary thrombosis"",""Kay Williams  (11 JulyÂ 1955 - 16 NovemberÂ 1960)Â (his death)Â (1 child)Sylvia Ashley  (20 DecemberÂ 1949 - 21 AprilÂ 1952)Â (divorced)Carole Lombard  (29 MarchÂ 1939 - 16 JanuaryÂ 1942)Â (her death)Maria Franklin Gable  (19 JulyÂ 1931 - 4 MarchÂ 1939)Â (divorced)Josephine Dillon  (13 DecemberÂ 1924 - 1 AprilÂ 1930)Â (divorced)"",""5"",""3"",""1"",""1"""

His father, Lew Abrikosov, was an agricultural technician, and his mother was a homemaker. Young Abrikosov left his parents' home as a teenager, and wandered all over Russia for several years, until he finally came to Moscow in 1925, at the age of 18. His first job was a metal worker at a Moscow industry, albeit he had a dream to become an actor, as he was fascinated by the silent movies.In the summer of 1925 Abrikosov entered the acting studio of Aleksandra Khokhlova, but soon moved to the acting class of Z.S. Sokolova, the sister of Konstantin Stanislavski. In 1926 Abrikosov joined the troupe of the Maly Theatre, but directors did not give him any roles to play for the next five years. However, in 1930 he was cast by directors Olga Preobrazhenskaya and Ivan Pravov as the main lead in the silent movie _Tikhiy Don (1931)_ (aka.. The Cossacks of the Don, or 'And Quiet Flows the Don') which was the first film adaptation of the eponymous novel by Mikhail Sholokhov. The film became popular in Russia and internationally, and Abrikosov became and instant celebrity.Andrei Abrikosov co-starred opposite Nikolay Cherkasov in the classic film Alessandro Nevsky (1938) by director Sergei M. Eisenstein, and played supporting roles in both parts of 'Ivan the Terrible'. He was awarded the State Stalin's Prize (1941) and was designated People's Actor of Russia (1952) and People's Actor of the USSR (1968). During the 1930s he was a member of the troupe with the Moscow Chamber Theatre under directorship of Aleksandr Tairov. From 1938 to 1973 Abrikosov was a permanent member of the troupe at the Vakhtangov Theatre, and from 1953-1959 he was artistic director of the Vakhtangov Theatre in Moscow.During the peak of their acting career, in the 1950s and 1960s, Andrei Abrikosov performed together with his son, Grigori Abrikosov. They enjoyed much success, which brought the attendant pressure, and both developed addiction to alcohol. Both father and son Abrikosovs were notorious in Moscow for their frequent stage appearances after and between their routine drinks, and acting under the influence. However, their performances were usually so good that both were able to get away with alcohol abuse at work. Some performances by the father and son Abrikosovs under the influence were described in famous jokes about their ability to improvise on stage when they were drunk and completely forgot their lines, so they borrowed random phrases from several other plays and were able to get away with it brilliantly, often leaving the public amazed with their improvisations.Andrei Abrikosov died on October 21, 1973, and was laid to rest in Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow, Russia."",""November 14, 1906 inÂ Simferopol, Taurida Governorate, Russian Empire [now Crimea, Ukraine]"",""14.11.1906"",""Simferopol, Taurida Governorate, Russian Empire [now Crimea, Ukraine]"",""October 21, 1973 inÂ Moscow, RSFSR, USSR [now Russia]"",""21.10.1973"",""Moscow, RSFSR, USSR [now Russia]"",,,""0"",""0"",""0"",""0"""

Her acting career began in vaudeville and stock-company drama before she moved in front of the cameras.In 1919 she came to California and negotiated a $200-a-week contract with a movie studio based on the strength of her relationship with her lover, the famed star Alla Nazimova. Within a few months she started another relationship with a younger, less established actress, Grace Darmond. In the midst of this love triangle she met the struggling actor Rudolph Valentino at a party, and they became friends. After a two-month courtship, he asked her to marry him and she accepted. On November 6, 1919, they married, and on their wedding night she locked him out. She wept, claiming she made a mistake and later departed to Grace Darmond's apartment. Valentino tried to reconcile with her but to no avail, and the marriage ended in divorce two years later when Valentino was a major star and Acker's star was waning.Newspapers had a field day when Valentino was charged with bigamy, as he hadn't waited long enough to marry his second wife, talented set and costume designer Natacha Rambova. Acker sued for the legal right to call herself Mrs. Rudolph Valentino, and Valentino remained angry at her for several years. However, they rekindled their friendship a few months before his death in 1926. She was one of the last people who saw him alive, and she attended his funeral with her mother. Soon after he died, she wrote and published a popular song about him, We Will Meet at the End of the Trail.She played bit parts in films, usually uncredited, until the early 1950s.

He has English, German, and Scottish ancestry. Jensen grew up in Richardson, Texas, together with his older brother, Joshua, and a younger sister, Mackenzie. Jensen graduated from Dartmouth Elementary School in 1990, he graduated from Apollo Junior High School in 1993, and LV Berkner High School in 1996.Jensen is a sports junkie. He loves football, lacrosse, baseball and basketball. He even played on the baseball and lacrosse teams in high school. The 6' 1 actor first started modeling when he was just 2 years old. When he turned 4, he started appearing in TV commercials for Nabisco, RadioShack and Wal-Mart. He caught the acting bug because he was mostly influenced by his father, who was an actor in Dallas. He used to watch his father study scripts, and that taught him a few things about the industry. During his later years in high school, he started taking theater classes, where he claimed he was the only jock in that department. When he was just a sophomore, a friend of Jensen had asked him to attend a local acting seminar. Two guys, Craig Wargo, and an agent, 'Michael Einfeld', were interested in Jensen's talent and wanted him to go to Los Angeles with them.Jensen had to say no to the offer and admitted at one point, he thought they would forget about him but, eventually, when he went to Los Angeles, he still managed to get help from them. Prior to that, Jensen actually planned to study sports medicine at Texas Tech University and become a physical therapist, before he decided to move to Los Angeles to give acting a try. In 1996, he managed to secure guest roles on several TV shows, which included Wishbone (1995), Mr. Rhodes (1996) and Sweet Valley High (1994). Jensen's big break came when he was cast in the NBC soap opera, Il tempo della nostra vita (1965), as Eric Brady in 1997. He won a Soap Opera Digest Award for Best Male Newcomer in 1998, and was nominated three times in 1998, 1999, and 2000 for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actor in a Drama Series for his work on Il tempo della nostra vita (1965). After spending about three years on a soap set, he left Il tempo della nostra vita (1965) and went on to appear in the mini-series Blonde (2001), which was about the life of Marilyn Monroe, playing Eddie G. He also auditioned for the role of Clark Kent on Smallville (2001), but lost the part to Tom Welling, instead.Not giving up hope, he went for a few auditions and managed to secure a guest role on the popular James Cameron TV series, Dark Angel (2000), as serial killer Ben/X5-493, the brother of main character Max/X5-452, who was played by Jessica Alba. His character died in the episode, but Jensen eventually returned to the show as a regular in the second season as Ben's clone, Alec/X5-494 and continued on until the show's cancellation in 2002. In 2003, he joined the cast of Dawson's Creek (1998), playing the role of C.J., Jen Lindley's lover. He also filmed episodes of the TV series, Still Life (2003), playing the role of Max Morgan, not knowing that the series was actually dropped. He also had a small role in the short film, The Plight of Clownana (2004), playing the role of Jensen. That same year, he was offered the part of Eliza Dushku's love interest on the second season of Tru Calling (2003). Jensen, however, turned down the role which was later offered to another actor, Eric Christian Olsen. He was subsequently cast on Smallville (2001), as Assistant football coach Jason Teague, the new love interest of Lana Lang. In 2005, Jensen managed to earn a lead role in the movie, Devour - Il gioco di Satana (2005), playing the role of Jake Gray. Jensen also earned the opportunity to work his father, actor Alan Ackles, who happened to play his character's father, Paul Kilton. The movie, however, received mixed reviews from the public.That same year, Jensen joined the cast of the CW series, Supernatural (2005), where he plays the role of Dean Winchester. Dean and his brother Sam, who is played by Jared Padalecki, are brothers who drive throughout the United States hunting paranormal predators, sometimes with their father, John Winchester, played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan. It was reported that the creator of the show, Eric Kripke, mentioned that the show will last for a maximum of five seasons. In 2006, Jensen took on a role in the Independently filmed comedy/drama movie, Ten Inch Hero (2007), which explores the theme of honesty and the flaw of judging by appearances. In 2007 the film began a limited run at number of film festivals including the Newport Beach Film Festival, Phoenix Film Festival and the Santa Cruz Film Festival but never made it into major mainstream theatrical release. In the Spring of 2008 Ten Inch Hero was released onto DVD exclusively through Blockbuster. Jensen however, received high praise for his work as Priestly, who one of the movie's more quirky characters.From June 5-10 in 2007 Jensen had his professional stage debut as Lt. Daniel Kaffee in A Few Good Men at Casa Manana Theatre in Fort Worth, Texas, working along side Lou Diamond Phillips. This proved to be another successful acting venture for Jensen, as critics were impressed with his work in this role. During his free time, Jensen enjoys golfing, horseback riding, scuba diving and photography. He is also a big fan of country music. His favorite musician is Garth Brooks. He even sang back-up vocals on good friend Steve Carlson's albums Spot in the Corner and Rollin' On. In the summer of 2008 Jensen traveled to Kittaning, PA to film the horror/thriller movie, San Valentino di sangue (2009), which was filmed in the cutting edge Real D technology, Jensen played the lead role of Tom Hanniger and starred alongside Jaime King and Kerr Smith.Jensen splits his time between Vancouver, British Columbia where he films Supernatural (2005) and his home in Austin, Texas."",""March 1, 1978 inÂ Dallas, Texas, USA"",""01.03.1978"",""Dallas, Texas, USA"",,,,,""Danneel Ackles  (15 MayÂ 2010 - present)Â (3 children)"",""1"",""0"",""1"",""3"""

He then focused on the arts as a career after enrolling at the Yale Drama School where he earned his Masters of Fine Arts in 1968.David gathered early professional credits at the Yale Repertory Theatre (for three seasons) and Williamstown Theatre Festival (for six seasons). He also found challenging and varied stage work outside the U.S. in Taiwan, Russia, Poland, Germany, France, and the Czech Republic.Dark-haired with a serious handsomeness to him, he was able to extend his all-stage career into film and TV in the early 1970s, beginning with daytime leading man outings in The Secret Storm and Another World. He progressed to prime time work as Gary Ewing in Dallas (1978) until Ted Shackelford successfully took over the role when the character moved front and center with the spin-off drama California (1979).A durable guest star on a slew of popular TV series including Lou Grant, The Paper Chase, Knot's Landing, The Facts of Life, Dynasty, St. Elsewhere, The A Team, Cagney and Lacey, Highway to Heaven, Doogie Howser, M.D., Murder, She Wrote, Walker, Texas Ranger and Xena: Warrior Princess, David also provided strong co-star support opposite a number of female stars in their vehicles as he did in the mini-series The Dark Secret of Harvest Home (1978) starring Bette Davis and numerous TV movies.Such TV movie offerings included La sopravvissuta (1978), Women in White (1979), Deadly Lessons (1983), When Your Lover Leaves (1983), I ribelli della notte (1986), Hell Hath No Fury (1991), Paura oltre la porta (1992), and The Prison (1994), in addition to four exceptional mini-series (The Word (1978), Nutcracker: Money, Madness & Murder (1987), Una povera ragazza ricca (1987) and I mulini a vento degli dei (1988)), plus a recurring role as Dr. Boyer in After MASH (1983) and Dr. Bart Langley in the series A Peaceable Kingdom (1989) starring Lindsay Wagner.He would also play a number of supporting roles in such movies as I giganti del West (1980), The Sound of Murder (1982), Wrestling with God (1990), Arma non convenzionale (1990), Per amore e per vendetta (1993), Delitto incrociato (1994), Giochi di guerra (1996), No Strings Attached (1997). His last to date was the lead role in an existential motorcycle movie inspired by Easy Rider entitled The Best Bar in America (2009).Prone to playing intelligent, upscale types or white-collar professionals (senators, doctors, lawyers, etc.), David continued to prevail on the stage with potent performances in Unlikely Heroes, his 1971 Broadway debut, The Rivals, Juno and the Paycock, Hamlet (as Rosencrantz), Private Lives, Children of a Lesser God (replacing original star John Rubinstein), A Soldier's Play, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, Six Characters in Search of an Author, and an 2003 off-Broadway appearance in It Just Catches. A well-seasoned narrator in documentary stories for the History Channel, he has sometimes utilized his well-modulated vocals for such animated cartoons as Johnny Quest and Captain Planet and the Planeteers.

The Soldier (1962) featuring a young William Shatner, was screened at the 1964 Venice Film Festival and went on to win prizes and accolades on the international film festival circuit.Guided by the legendary Walter Blake, Acosta moved quickly into the world of cinema as writer, consultant, cinematographer-director.

On a spiritual journey, Acosta traveled throughout Africa and Europe for almost two decades. During his 1980 pilgrimage to India he met and filmed many great spiritual beings including Mahavatar Babaji, Narayana Shastriji and Sathya Sai Baba.In 1988, with an international repertory devoted crew, Acosta began working on his first full-length independent motion picture as director, writer, cinematographer and producer. The internationally-acclaimed Romeo.Juliet (1990) held its World Premiere on September 6, 1990 at the 47th Venice Film Festival.Invited by festival director, Guglielmo Biraghi to screen Romeo.Juliet out of competition, the film stars the great British talents of Sir John Hurt with the voice-overs by Vanessa Redgrave, Sir Ben Kingsley, Dame Maggie Smith, Quentin Crisp,Robert Powell, Victor Spinetti and Francesca Annis.The soundtrack features Sergei Prokofiev's 'Romeo and Juliet Ballet' with AndrĂ© Previn conducting the London Symphony Orchestra.

Maestro Nicholas Cleobury conducted the National Orchestra of Belgium in three sold out performances. Further film concerts were held in Japan to sold out audiences and standing ovations.In the year 2000, Acosta was reunited with his mentor Roger Corman at the Flanders International Film Festival in Ghent, Belgium. They met once again at the 2009 Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Governor's Ball when Roger Corman received his Honorary Life Achievement Academy Award.Most recently Acosta brought together - for the first time in cinematic history - three Italian maestros with their collective nine Academy Awards: Vittorio Storaro, Cinematographer, Dante Ferretti, Production Designer and Francesca Lo Schiavo, Set Decorator, participated in Acosta's The Living Tableau, an exacting recreation of DaVinci's masterpiece, scheduled to be released in limited engagements in 2019/2020 in commemoration of Leonardo DaVinci's 500th birthday.

While being always convincing with, in addition, this Gallic touch that made (and still makes) him a treat to look at and to listen to.Born in 1908 in AsniĂ¨res, a North-West suburb of Paris, Alfred Adam proved multi-talented as of a young age. Besides becoming an actor, he studied civil engineering, wrote plays (his most famous being 'Sylvie et le fantĂ´me'), penned film screenplays and dialogs and even the argument for a Roland Petit ballet. He also showed a life long interest in reading, sport (boxing, tennis, soccer), good food and friendship. He was a local figure in Montmartre where he lived, gaily strolling the streets in his long long coat and his wide wide hat.But acting was his main activity and he did interpret scores of roles, whether at the theater, for the cinema or television.Trained at the Conservatoire by Louis Jouvet, he worked for him between 1935 and 1939 before being hired by another great name, Charles Dullin and becoming a member of the ComĂ©die FranĂ§aise. Ever an open-minded artist, Alfred Adam never said no to a good light comedy.As far as movies are concerned he debuted in 1935 in Jacques Feyder's masterpiece 'La kermesse hĂ©roĂŻque'.

Born Ronald George Hinings Adams on the last day of 1896, he was educated at University College, London. When still only 17 years of age, Adams volunteered to join the British army on the outbreak of the first world war. On December 2nd 1914, he was commissioned as a temporary second Lieutenant in the 15th (reserve) battalion of the Middlesex regiment. He then transferred to the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) as an observer and then undertook pilot training. Adams then served with 18 squadron and flew Sopwith Camel's with 44 squadron on home defense duties. He then joined 73 squadron, also flying Sopwith Camel's in France. On April 7th 1918, he was shot down near Villers-Brettoneux in northern France. Historians still debate who shot down Adams, some argue his victor was Ltn Hans Kirchstein, but many others think that he was the 78th victim of the legendary Baron Manfred von Richthofen, known to history as The Red Baron. Adams was wounded and captured and, on the evening of his aerial defeat, was visited by a German orderly who gave him Von Richthofen's compliments. Ronald Adams spent eight months in hospitals and prison camps before he was re-repatriated on 17th December 1918, the 15th anniversary of the Wright brothers first powered flight.Post-war Adams trained as a chartered accountant and then moved into theatre management, running the Embassy Theatre in London. He then decided to become an actor proper, altering his name slightly to Ronald Adam. He also wrote books and several of his plays were staged. From 1936 he began to work in films. On the outbreak of the second world war Ronald Adam rejoined the Royal Air Force (RAF) and during the Battle of Britain which raged over England in the summer of 1940 he was the fighter controller for the Hornchurch sector. No matter how good the RAF's Spitfire and Hurricanes were, they could not be effective unless they could intercept the armada of incoming German planes. It was Wing Commander Ronald Adam's job to co-ordinate the RAF fighter command interceptions from data gathered by radar and ground observers and then dispatch fighters to intercept. It was a vital role in one of histories decisive battles in which the future of western civilization was at stake. Post war Ronald Adam lived in Surbiton, Surrey and died on 28th March 1979.

She was raised in a Mormon family of seven children in Castle Rock, Colorado, and has English, as well as smaller amounts of Danish, Swiss-German, and Norwegian, ancestry.Adams sang in the school choir at Douglas County High School and was an apprentice dancer at a local dance company, with the ambition of becoming a ballerina. However, she worked as a greeter at The Gap and as a Hooters hostess to support herself before finding work as a dancer at Boulder's Dinner Theatre and Country Dinner Playhouse in such productions as Brigadoon and A Chorus Line. It was there that she was spotted by a Minneapolis dinner-theater director who asked her to move to Chanhassen, Minnesota for more regional dinner theatre work.Nursing a pulled muscle that kept her from dancing, she was free to audition for a part in Bella da morire (1999), which was filming nearby in Minnesota. During the filming, Kirstie Alley encouraged her to move to Los Angeles, where she soon won a part in the Fox television version of the film, Cruel Intentions - Prima regola non innamorarsi (1999), in the part played in the film by Sarah Michelle Gellar, Kathryn Merteuil. Although three episodes were filmed, the troubled series never aired. Instead, parts of the episodes were cobbled together and released as the direct-to-video Cruel Intentions 2 (2000). After more failed television spots, she landed a major role in Prova a prendermi (2002), playing opposite Leonardo DiCaprio. But this did not provide the break-through she might have hoped for, with no work being offered for about a year. She eventually returned to television, and joined the short-lived series, Dr. Vegas (2004).Her role in the low-budget independent film Junebug (2005) (which was shot in 21 days) got her real attention, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress as well as other awards. The following year, her ability to look like a wide-eyed Disney animated heroine helped her to be chosen from about 300 actresses auditioning for the role of Giselle in the animated/live-action feature film, Come d'incanto (2007), which would prove to be her major break-through role. Her vivacious yet innocent portrayal allowed her to use her singing and dancing talents. Her performance garnered a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.Adams next appeared in the major production, La guerra di Charlie Wilson (2007), and went on to act in the independent film, Sunshine Cleaning (2008), which premiered at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival. Her role as Sister James in Il dubbio (2008) brought her a second Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress, as well as nominations for a Golden Globe, a Screen Actors Guild award, and a British Academy Film award.

From 1959 until 1970 he went to Brentwood school in Essex, and his main interest was science. As a student in Cambridge he decided to hitch-hike through Europe to Istanbul, and in order to raise funds for this he took a lot of small jobs. In 1970 he left school to become a writer, certain that success was just around the corner. But nothing happened. He worked with the late Monty Python member Graham Chapman and John Lloyd, but hardly anything they did was published.On February 4 1977 he met Simon Brett, who then was doing Radio 4's 'The Burkiss Way'. They agreed to produce a science fiction comedy show on radio. This was the birth of the Hitch-hikers Guide to the Galaxy.Douglas Adams married Jane Belson on November 24 1991 and they have a daughter by the name Polly Jane, born on June 22, 1994. They lived in Islington, but in 1999 they moved to California, USA. In 1997 Douglas signed a deal with Disney to make a feature movie, and he immediately started working on the screenplay. Jay Roach, of Austin Powers fame, was signed as director.On the morning of May 11 2001, Adams went to the local gym to work out. There he suffered a massive heart attack and all attempts to revive him were unsuccessful. He died, and left his 6 year old daughter Polly, his wife Jane, his mother Jan Thrift, brother James and countless other family members and friends, not to mention thousands and thousands of fans all over the world, in shock and mourning.Author of the hysterically funny series of books, summarized as Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which also include a radio series, a TV series, stage play, record albums, computer game, graphic novels and a bath towel.He also wrote the Dirk Gently novels and a non fiction book, Last Chance to See, about endangered species. Apart from being a writer, he was also a chicken shed cleaner, bodyguard for an Arab royal family and he actually at one time played guitar for Pink Floyd (42nd birthday gift from David Gilmour, an old friend).Douglas co-founded the company The Digital Village (now h2g2), producing nearly everything that has to do with media: TV, movies, computer games etc. He was one of the creators of Starship Titanic, a combined book (co-written with Terry Jones of the Monty Python bunch) and computer game.It was often claimed that P.G. Wodehouse had influence on him and his work, and when once asked about this he replied: Yes, a huge impact. But not an early impact. I didn't start reading Wodehouse until I was writing 'Restaurant at the end of the universe'. I can see the impact starting almost immediately.

"nm0010944,""Edie Adams"",""Edith Elizabeth Enke"",""168"",""The scintillating, sultry-eyed blonde (formerly a redhead) star of screen, TV and award-winning stage went on to become best known, however, for her sensual delivery pitching cigars in taunting '60s ads and commercials with her Mae Westian come-on line Why don't you pick one up and smoke it sometime? This, of course, was at a time when smoking was considered quite sexy and fashionable, and Edie Adams went above and beyond the call of duty in making these ads legendary.Edie had her hand dipped in all pools of entertainment. She was a singing siren, an award-winning Broadway musical entertainer, a deft impressionist and comedienne, a serious dramatic actress, a commercial saleswoman and a viable TV celebrity. Off-stage, she showed remarkable poise and resourcefulness when her famous first husband, landmark TV comic Ernie Kovacs, was tragically killed in a January 1962 car crash in Los Angeles and she found her family finances in dire straits.She was born Edith Elizabeth Enke on April 16, 1927, in the relatively small town of Kingston, Pennsylvania, but moved while fairly young to Grove City. Her family relocated again, this time to Tenafly, New Jersey, where she grew up. Following her graduation from high school, Edie aspired to become an opera singer and studied voice and piano at New York's Juilliard School of Music. She then went on to take acting classes at the Columbia School of Drama.Her theatrical debut occurred with a 1947 production of Blithe Spirit, and a year later she appeared in the stage show Goodnight Ladies. Gradually building up her singing reputation via the nightclub circuit, her big break came when Arthur Godfrey booked her on his Talent Scouts show. She didn't come out the winner, but a TV director who caught sight of her performance envisioned in her a seductive straight man who could mesh well with a certain zany comedian. In 1951, Edie (then known as Edith Adams) was signed up as a featured singer on Ernie Kovacs's comedy show that originated in Philadelphia. The show, live and unrehearsed, became an innovative, groundbreaking effort in the relatively new medium. Outrageous and even incomprehensible at times, his comedy was deemed way ahead of its time and, as a result, had problems reaching mainstream audiences who didn't get it, and the programs were short-lived. Various Kovacs platforms that included Edie were Ernie in Kovacsland (1951), Kovacs on the Korner (1952), and, of course, The Ernie Kovacs Show (1952). She and Kovacs eloped to Mexico City in 1954 and their union produced a daughter, Mia Kovacs. The duo were a popular couple in the Hollywood social circuit (moving there from New York in the late '50s) and the connections she developed out there were quite valuable in furthering her career.Early '50s TV opened many doors for Edie and she waltzed right through them. Her New York stage debut in the popular musical Wonderful Town in 1952 had her walking away with the Theatre World Award for Best Newcomer. A few years later, she slithered away with a supporting Tony Award for her bodacious take on the Daisy Mae character in the musical Li'l Abner (1956). Following that were more musical and dramatic ventures on the stage, including The Merry Widow (1957) (a show she would return to more than once), Sweet Bird of Youth (1960) and Free as a Bird (1960). On film, Edie showed the public that she wasn't just a pretty face with her sharply unsympathetic supporting performance in Billy Wilder's L'appartamento (1960) and a funny, sexier one in the second of Rock Hudson and Doris Day's three battle-of-the-sexes romps, Amore, ritorna! (1961). Surprisingly, Edie and Ernie never appeared together in a film. Edie remained primarily a TV fixture and, outside of her Emmy-nominated coupling with Kovacs, winningly played the Fairy Godmother in Julie Andrews' popular TV version of Cinderella (1957), appeared regularly with Jack Paar and Dinah Shore on their respective variety shows, acted on various prime-time shows, and graced a number of celebrity game and talk show panels.One of Edie's last pairings with Kovacs was in 1960 when they appeared as guests on the very last episode of The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour (1957). The pair appeared as themselves, with one of the highlights being Edie crooning the lovely ballad That's All. Kovacs' sudden 1962 death was a terrible reversal of fortunes for Edie. An inveterate gambler, he left her owing much money to the IRS. Instead of filing bankruptcy, however, she worked her way out of debt. In the process, her career received a second wind. Perhaps it didn't hurt that the public adored Edie and that she was a genuinely sympathetic figure in the wake of her private tragedy.She returned to the nightclub circuit from whence she came, recorded albums, and also toured the country in various dramatic and musical comedy vehicles, including Rain (as Sadie Thompson), Bells Are Ringing, Annie Get Your Gun (as Annie Oakley), I Do! I Do!, Anything Goes and Bus Stop. She also received outstanding notices in a few of her films, whether dramas (Strano incontro (1963), L'amaro sapore del potere (1964)) or frivolous comedies (Chiamami buana (1963), Questo pazzo, pazzo, pazzo, pazzo mondo (1963), Sotto l'albero yum yum (1963), Masquerade (1967)). Moreover, she was handed her own musical variety show Here's Edie (1963) (aka The Edie Adams Show) and received a couple of Emmy nominations for her efforts. She also took advantage of her famous impressions of Zsa Zsa Gabor and others, appearing in various TV comedy formats.More than anything, however, it was her come-hither temptress pitching Muriel cigars that had TV audiences' tongues wagging. It was a smashingly successful and highly profitable coup for Edie professionally. Her late husband, a notorious cigar smoker, at one time sold Dutch Master cigars on TV. The idea then for Edie to pitch a competing slimmer cigar on TV was only natural. She had much to do with the direction of the commercials, which ran throughout the 1960s, providing them with a perfect blend of class, glamour and sensuality.While growing noticeably heavier in later years, she never lost her trademark humor and sex appeal. Edie could still be seen from time to time on the stage in such shows as The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas, the female version of The Odd Couple, Hello, Dolly! and Nunsense. She remained committed to the end to restoring/preserving her late husband's videotapes and kinescopes of his ground-breaking '50s TV work. She also recalled her offbeat life with Kovacs in the book Sing a Pretty Song, which was published in 1990.Edie got married again in 1964, to photographer Marty Mills, with whom she had a son, Josh Mills. That union ended in divorce in 1971. The following year, Edie married jazz trumpeter Pete Candoli. She and Candoli, who died in January of 2008, divorced in 1989. In another eerie, tragic circumstance, daughter Mia Kovacs was killed in a 1982 Los Angeles auto accident at age 22 -- 20 years after her father's similar demise. Suffering from cancer and losing weight in her latter years, the beloved Edie died of complications from pneumonia at age 81 in Los Angeles."",""April 16, 1927 inÂ Kingston, Pennsylvania, USA"",""16.04.1927"",""Kingston, Pennsylvania, USA"",""October 15, 2008 inÂ Los Angeles, California, USA Â (pneumonia)"",""15.10.2008"",""Los Angeles, California, USA Â "",""pneumonia"",""Pete Candoli  (4 JuneÂ 1972 - 28 AugustÂ 1988)Â (divorced)Martin Mills  (16 AugustÂ 1964 - 1971)Â (divorced)Â (1 child)Ernie Kovacs  (12 SeptemberÂ 1954 - 13 JanuaryÂ 1962)Â (his death)Â (1 child)"",""3"",""2"",""2"",""2"""

"nm0011105,""Julie Adams"",""Betty May Adams"",""168"",""Betty May Adams was the daughter of a travelling Iowa cotton buyer with a penchant for alcohol. Growing up in Arkansas, Betty expressed an early interest in acting and made her performing debut in a third grade play of Hansel and Gretel. Beautiful, talented and determined, the freshly minted 'Miss Little Rock' left home at the age of 19 to live with her aunt and uncle in California. For three days a week she made ends meet working as a secretary. The remainder of her time was spent taking speech and drama lessons (in due course losing her Southern twang) and making the rounds of the various Hollywood casting departments. Her first screen role was (appropriately) as a starlet in Paramount's Ho sposato un demonio (1949). This was followed by an inauspicious leading role in the B-grade Western The Dalton Gang (1949). Over a period of five weeks she appeared in six further quota quickies of the sagebrush variety for Poverty Row outfit Lippert Productions. Since Lippert owned no actual studio facilities, most of the filming took place at the Ray Corrigan ranch in Chatsworth, California. In the summer of 1950, Betty assisted in a screen test for Detroit Lions football star Leon Hart at Universal-International. While Hart's movie career ended up stillborn, Betty clicked with producers who opted to change her first name to 'Julia'. The initial outing for her new studio was entitled Vittoria sulle tenebre (1951), with the budding actress a little underemployed as 'the other girl' in a love triangle involving a blind war veteran (played by Arthur Kennedy). Her career was significantly better served in her next assignment as co-star opposite James Stewart in Anthony Mann's seminal Technicolor western LĂ  dove scende il fiume (1952) (Kennedy this time cast as the arch villain). Adams later recalled her part in this film as a great learning experience and one of her fondest Hollywood memories. It also led to a life long friendship with Jimmy Stewart.Signed to a seven-year contract (and having her legs insured by Universal to the tune of $125,000 by Lloyds of London), Julia seemed destined to remain perpetually typecast as a western heroine. A comely actress with soft, classical features, she often gave affecting performances in what amounted to little more than bread-and-butter pictures. At the very least, she got to play romantic leads opposite some of Universal's top box-office earners: Rock Hudson (in Dan il terribile (1952) and Il diario di un condannato (1952)), Tyrone Power(L'avventuriero della Louisiana (1953)) and Glenn Ford (Il traditore di Fort Alamo (1953)). Having played a succession of 'nice girls', Julia took a turn as leader of an outlaw gang in Le ali del falco (1953), set against the background of the Mexican Revolution (Van Heflin was first-billed as a mining engineer, who, having his gold mine taken over by Federales, joins Julia's band of 'insurrectos'). 'Miss Melon Patch' of 1953 was about to experience another important career change, being famously cast as the imperilled heroine Kay Lawrence in Jack Arnolds cultish monster flic Il mostro della laguna nera (1954), a role Adams initially considered turning down. Shot in 3-D on a shoestring budget, the picture was light on script but strong on atmosphere and proved once again that style can succeed over content. The not inconsiderable physical charms of Miss Adams often dominated the scenery and gave the 'Gill Man' a run for his money. Audiences approved and 'Creature' spawned two further sequels, alas without Julia and with diminishing returns.In 1955, having generated strong box office heat, Julia changed her moniker (with studio approval) to the less gentle-sounding Julie. Accordingly, she was now offered more varied material ranging from tough melodramas, to comedies and lightweight romances. Adams further established her credentials with roles which included a soft porn model who survives a plane crash in the Colorado Rockies in Gli sciacalli (1955) as a cop's wife in La rapina del secolo (1955) (a crime drama based on Boston's Great Brinks Robbery) a sympathetic school's doctor in the family-oriented comedy La guerra privata del maggiore Benson (1955) and as the wife of an assistant D.A. fighting gangland on the New York waterfront in I bassifondi del porto (1957). After 1957, her contract with Universal having expired, Adams successfully transitioned into television where she remained a firm favourite in westerns and crime dramas, guest-starring in just about every classic prime-time series covering both genres (Perry Mason (1957) being her personal favourite). Latterly, she had a popular recurring role as real estate lady Eve Simpson in La signora in giallo (1984). Adams was still in demand for occasional screen appearances well into her 90s.She was married twice: first, to writer-producer Leonard Stern, and, secondly, to the actor Ray Danton. Julie Adams passed away in Los Angeles on February 3 2019 at the age of 92.

"nm0011293,""Richard Adams"",""Richard George Adams"",""178"",""Richard Adams spent his first 52 years in relative anonymity. And when he did complete a book that he wrote, he struggled to find anyone to publish it.Richard George Adams was born on 9 May 1920, in Newbury, Berkshire. He was the son of a country doctor and was brought up in the rolling countryside with views towards the real Watership Down, on the Hampshire border. One of his earliest memories was seeing a local man pushing a handcart full of dead rabbits down the street. It made me realise, in an instant, that rabbits were things and that it was only in a baby's world that they were not.He suffered the fate of many middle-class boys of the period when he was sent to boarding school at the age of nine, where, by all accounts, he had a miserable time. He won a scholarship to Worcester College, Oxford, but his education was interrupted by World War Two and he served for five years in the Army before returning to his studies. He joined the civil service and spent part of his career managing the clean air programme designed to reduce pollution, especially that caused by the many coal fires still burning in British households. The event that changed his life occurred on a car journey with his family to see Twelfth Night at Stratford-upon-Avon. His bored children asked for a story and he began telling them a tale about a group of rabbits attempting to escape from their threatened warren.Adams was persuaded to write it all down, a process that took him more than two years, but he was, at first, unable to find a publisher. Many of his rejection letters complained that the book was too long and his characters did not fit the common perception of cuddly bunnies. His rabbits were described with biological realism they defecated, had sex and engaged in violent battles for dominance. Eventually, in 1972, after 14 rejections, the publisher Rex Collings saw the potential and agreed to take it on with an initial print run of 2,500 copies.It was hailed as a children's classic, going on to sell more than 50 million copies, helped along by readings on BBC radio, and a dramatic performance in London's Regent's Park. Watership Down sold particularly well in the US where canny distributors placed it on the adult publishing list. On his promotional tours across the Atlantic, Adams played the American idea of the archetypical Englishman, wearing a bowler hat and insisting on English marmalade and mustard wherever he went. The book, and a subsequent animated film in 1978, became synonymous with rabbits and at least one enterprising butcher advertised: You've read the book, you've seen the film, now eat the cast.Inevitably it attracted criticism from some highbrow reviewers. There is something to be said for myxomatosis, was one caustic comment. The sudden flow of wealth enabled Adams to retire from the civil service and become a full-time writer. It also drove him into tax exile on the Isle of Man, although he later returned to his roots in southern England. By the time Watership Down was published, he was already writing his second book Shardik, the novel he considered his best work.It is an epic tale of a bear who is a god in an imaginary world and who is abused by the humans in the story. Shardik did not find favour among critics with some describing it as preachy, a judgement with which Adams did not disagree. His commitment to animal welfare was expressed in his third novel, The Plague Dogs, an outspoken attack on animal experimentation. He admitted that his indignation about vivisection might have got the better of him but the book became another best-seller.He became president of the RSPCA but his attempts to persuade the charity to adopt a more campaigning stance did not find favour with some of the more conservative members of the ruling council. He resigned just ahead of a vote which would have severely curtailed his presidential powers. Despite his campaigning for animals he insisted he was not a sentimentalist. He refused to condemn a decision to gas rabbits on the real Watership Down in 1998 after their burrows began undermining the hill. If I saw a rabbit in my garden I'd shoot it, he once said.In all, he wrote more than 20 books, including The Girl in a Swing, a ghostly love story with an undercurrent of eroticism, and a prequel to Shardik - entitled Maia - which was criticised for its sexual and sado-masochistic content. None of these books achieved the success of Watership Down and even a 1997 sequel, Tales from Watership Down, failed to capture the magic of the original. Richard Adams was essentially a traditional Englishman with a love of the countryside and a belief that, somehow, things were better in the past. It is perhaps surprising that this natural conservative, from a conventional middle-class background, should have written a book which had such a revolutionary impact on children's literature.Richard Adams died on Christmas Eve 2016, aged 96."",""May 9, 1920 inÂ Newbury, Berkshire, England, UK"",""09.05.1920"",""Newbury, Berkshire, England, UK"",""December 24, 2016 inÂ Shropshire, England, UK Â (natural causes)"",""24.12.2016"",""Shropshire, England, UK Â "",""natural causes"",""Barbara Elizabeth Acland  (26 SeptemberÂ 1949 - 24 DecemberÂ 2016)Â (his death)Â (2 children)"",""1"",""0"",""1"",""2"""

Adams attended Hamilton College in Clinton, NY, and upon graduation began working as a newspaper reporter and later editor.In the early years of the 20th century Adams became one of the pioneers in muckraking journalism with his exposes on the patent-medicine industry published in Collier's Magazine. He would later write a number of informational articles on health and medicine and become an associate member of the American Medical Association, even though he lacked a background in medicine. Adams was probably the first journalist to write articles on health that could be understood by the average readerAdams' first novel, The Clarion, was published in 1914 and told the story of an idealistic editor trying to run an honest newspaper amid unscrupulous advertisers and corrupt politicians. A reoccurring theme throughout Adams' novels was the triumph of idealism over corruption. He wrote biographies on writer Alexander Woollcott, American politician Daniel Webster and President Warren G. Harding. Earlier supporters of Harding tried to suppress Adams' novel Revelry (1926) for its portrayal of the various scandals that had plagued the Harding administration. Adams wrote a number of detective Average Jones mystery stories that would later be adapted to radio. Under the pseudonym Warner Fabian he wrote several novels about the Lost Generation in the years following World War I, of which Flaming Youth (1923) was probably his best known.An expert on the history of New York state, Adams wrote a series of articles for The New Yorker on the Erie Canal that were gathered together in 1955 and published under the title Godfather Stories. He also authored Canal Town (1944) that told the story of the canal's construction, Banner by the Wayside about a 19th-century troupe of traveling New York actors and Sunrise to Sunset, which chronicled the rise of the union movement in New York's garment district.Adams married Elizabeth R. Noyes (1877-1957) of Charleston, WV, in 1898. The couple had two daughters before their divorce in 1915.

Al's first foray into filmmaking was helping his father as director and producer on the movie Halfway to Hell (1953). In the mid-'60s Al founded the prolific grindhouse outfit Independent-International Pictures with producer/distributor Samuel M. Sherman. Adamson cranked out flicks in every conceivable genre: scuzzy biker items (Satan's Sadists (1969), Smashing il racket del crimine (1970), Angels' Wild Women (1972)), grungy westerns (Five Bloody Graves (1969), Jessi's Gun - la banda delle donne maledette (1975)), smarmy softcore sex comedies (Attenti... arrivano le svedesi tutto sesso! (1973), Blazing Stewardesses (1975)), funky blaxploitation (Mean Mother (1973), Black Heat (1976)), ridiculous science-fiction dross (the gloriously ghastly 7 per l'infinito contro i mostri spaziali (1970)), two Jim Kelly martial arts action outings (Black Samurai (1976), Gli amici del drago (1978)), lurid horror fare (Dracula vs. Frankenstein (1971), Brain of Blood (1971), Nurse Sherri (1978)) and even a tongue-in-cheek softcore science-fiction musical (Cinderella 2000 (1977)). Moreover, Adamson served as a producer for both the exciting Fred Williamson blaxploitation vehicle Hammer (1972) and the acclaimed made-for-TV drama Consegne a domicilio (1973). The casts of Adamson's movies were made up of oddball but enthusiastic amateurs and faded professional thespians whose career was on the wane, including Kent Taylor, Russ Tamblyn, Lon Chaney Jr. and the ubiquitous John Carradine. Al frequently gave his wife Regina Carrol sizable parts in his films. Moreover, Adamson was a mentor for future schlock-feature directors Greydon Clark and John 'Bud' Cardos. He was also instrumental in launching the career of ace cinematographer Gary Graver. In addition, Adamson kept fellow top cinematographers LĂˇszlĂł KovĂˇcs and Vilmos Zsigmond employed in their early days.Al Adamson's life came to a brutal and untimely end at age 66 when he was murdered by live-in contractor Fred Fulford on August 2, 1995."",""July 25, 1929 inÂ Hollywood, California, USA"",""25.07.1929"",""Hollywood, California, USA"",""August 2, 1995 inÂ Indio, California, USA Â (homicide)"",""02.08.1995"",""Indio, California, USA Â "",""homicide"",""Stevee Ashlock  (1 MarchÂ 1993 - 21 JuneÂ 1995)Â (his death)Regina Carrol  (1972 - 4 NovemberÂ 1992)Â (her death)"",""2"",""0"",""0"",""0"""

"nm0011535,""Victor Adamson"",""Albert B. Adamson"",,""Someday a clever producer will tell the story of Hollywood's Poverty Row of the 1920s-'40s (although Pazzo pazzo West! (1975) was a valiant effort, it left a lot to be desired), which was centered on Gower Street. So many fly-by-night production companies--which cranked out mostly westerns, because they were so cheap to shoot--were headquartered there that the area became known as Gower Gulch. Such a story would have to include Victor Adamson, a man whose unique, if inept, cinematic vision rivaled that of schlockmeister icons Dwain Esper, Robert J. Horner and later, the King of the Hollywood hacks himself, Edward D. Wood Jr..Although he was born in Kansas City, Missouri in 1890, Adamson's family moved to New Zealand when he was very young, and he was raised there. He returned to the USA around 1916 or 1917, and attempted to break into the burgeoning film business in Hollywood, California. He had been a champion horse rider and roper while living on a ranch in New Zealand and thought he was ripe for stardom in westerns. He brought with him a small film he had made in New Zealand and, astonishingly enough, actually managed to find a company willing to release it. After landing a few uncredited small parts in a few small silent movies in 1920s, Adamson decided that the best road to stardom was one he would make himself, so he began to produce, direct, and star in his own films, using the name Art Mix. (and later under the name Denver Dixon). Here's where it gets really confusing: for reasons known only to himself he decided to have an actor named George Kesterson also play the Art Mix character and, in an even more confusing turn of events, once hired a rodeo champion named Bob Roberts to also play Art Mix. Cowboy superstar Tom Mix eventually filed a copyright infringement suit against Adamson because of his use of the Mix name. In a move that could only happen in Hollywood, Adamson got around that by finding a man whose real name actually was Art Mix and hiring him to play the character--so at one point there were four different men playing a cowboy named Art Mix! Kesterson and Adamson eventually parted ways, but Kesterson used the Art Mix name, despite Adamson's efforts to stop him, for the remainder of his career.It didn't really matter that much who played Art Mix, though, as Adamson's films, all low-budget in the extreme with a reputation for laugh-inducing incompetence, were released via the states rights system--in which regional distributors bought the prints outright and kept them in circulation for as long as they could remain spliced together--which meant that not a whole lot of people wound up seeing them anyway. Even the most die-hard western fan had trouble sitting through an Art Mix feature on the bottom half of a Saturday-afternoon matinee. Most of his sound movie productions in the 1930s were filmed in only two or three days with low budgets of $2,000 or so, featuring actors who had trouble remembering their lines, misspelled title cards, headache-inducing editing, a near total lack of understanding of sound, and very often the use of an impaired (visually or otherwise) cinematographer (i.e., his $2,500 out-of-focus extravaganza, Range Riders (1934), in which the cameraman's competence apparently wasn't as important as his willingness to work for next to nothing).Adamson (working under his pseudonym 'Denver Dixon') continued to produce, direct, and star in his own bottom-of-the-barrel westerns and appeared in small roles in oaters made by others until the late 1930s, when he decided to concentrate his career mainly on writing and acting, confining his roles to small parts in the innumerable B westerns being churned out in Hollywood at the time. He continued acting in small roles in various films and television shows until his death in 1972 from a heart attack at age 82.His son, director/producer Al Adamson, kept his legacy as well as the family name and reputation alive in the low-budget film market by grinding out micro-budgeted westerns, hilariously inept horror films and vapid softcore sex comedies for decades--he even managed to cash in on the blaxploitation craze of the '70s with a couple of clunkers--until his murder, by a building contractor with whom he was having a legal dispute, in 1995."",""January 4, 1890 inÂ Auckland, New Zealand"",""1890-01-04"",""Auckland, New Zealand"",""November 9, 1972 inÂ Los Angeles, California, USA Â (heart attack)"",""09.11.1972"",""Los Angeles, California, USA Â "",""heart attack"",""Dolores Booth  (? - 1959)Â (3 children)"",""1"",""0"",""1"",""3"""

Her career commenced on the repertory stage, with tours of both England and continental Europe. In 1950, she was signed by MGM and appeared in her first feature, Solitudine (1951). She acted in several other well-received A-grade productions, including Gli avventurieri di Plymouth (1952), La regina vergine (1953) and La tunica (1953). For Otto Preminger's vaguely controversial (due to violations of the prevailing morals code by using words like 'virgin') La vergine sotto il tetto (1953), Dawn was on loan to United Artists. In January 1953, she joined other MGM contract stars on a USO tour of Korea. In Charles Chaplin's Un re a New York (1957) she had another starring opportunity as an advertising woman who gets involved with royalty. That seemed to mirror her personal life, since Dawn became an actress-princess (prior to Grace Kelly getting that gig) by marrying the Italian nobleman Don Vittorio Massimo in 1954. The marriage ended after just four years in separation and was finally dissolved in 1971.By the early 60s, offers for glamorous roles had diminished and Dawn was down to playing hapless heroines in European co-productions, second string horrors like Il mostro di Londra (1960) (as Jekyll's wife Kitty who ends up being raped and driven to suicide by his evil alter-ego, Mr. Hyde) and potboilers like Fritz Lang's final directorial effort Il diabolico Dr. Mabuse (1960).

"nm0011741,""Wesley Addy"",""Robert Wesley Addy"",,""Character actor Wesley Addy began his prolific career as a prime player on the classical stage before coming to occasional films and TV in the early 1950s. Known for his intelligent, white-collar demeanor and lean, icy, cultivated menace, the silver-haired performer, who was actually born in Omaha, Nebraska, was often mistaken as British.Majoring in economics at the University of California in Los Angeles, Wesley switched gears and trained in summer theater on Martha's Vineyard before trekking to New York City to pursue a professional career. In 1935, the actor made his Broadway stage debut with Orson Welles in Archibald Macleish's Panic. He continued with roles as both Marcellus and Fortinbras in Leslie Howard's production of Hamlet. Other Shakespearean roles during this early period included Hotspur in Henry IV, Part I, Benvolio in Romeo and Juliet and Orsino in Twelfth Night. He often performed the Bard in the company of such legendary interpreters as Orson Welles, Laurence Olivier and, more frequently, Maurice Evans.World War II interrupted Addy's early momentum but he eventually returned to the theatre following his tour of duty and played opposite Katharine Cornell in Antigone and Candida. A continued presence on Broadway, he had strong stage roles in The Traitor, Another Part of the Forest, King Lear and The Leading Lady.In 1951, the 38-year-old Addy made his film debut in the drama, La prima legione (1951), and would be seen from time to time throughout the decade in such dramatic fare as Ultime della notte (1952), I miei sei forzati (1952) and La mano invisibile (1956). Some of his chillier roles came in films directed by Robert Aldrich, who utilized the actor quite often -- Un bacio e una pistola (1955), Il grande coltello (1955), La giungla della 7a strada (1957), Dieci secondi col diavolo (1959) and the Grand Guignol classics, Che fine ha fatto Baby Jane? (1962) and Piano... piano, dolce Carlotta (1964).Never acquiring a strong footing in the movies, Wesley changed his on-camera focus in the 1960s to TV and also sought out theatre roles, as well. In 1961, Wesley married actress Celeste Holm. Together, they proved a strong stage coupling in both comedies and dramas -- Invitation to a March, A Month in the Country, Mame, Candida, Light Up the Sky, Mama and With Love and Laughter.A reliable, durable performer, Wesley played suave gents and villains on TV. A major portion of his work came from daytime soaps -- including Ai confini della notte (1956), Il tempo della nostra vita (1965), I Ryan (1975) and Quando si ama (1983). Later films included Operazione diabolica (1966), Quinto potere (1976), Gli europei (1979) and Il verdetto (1982). He continued to act close to the end. His last film role was as a judge in Prima e dopo (1996) starring Meryl Streep and Liam Neeson, which was released in the year of his death.

"nm0011748,""George Ade"",""George Ade"",,""American writer, newspaper columnist, and playwright George Ade was first and foremost a self described Hoosier. Ade was born in Kentland, Indiana, one of seven children raised by John and Adaline Ade. While attending Purdue University, he met and started a lifelong friendship with cartoonist and Sigma Chi brother John T. McCutcheon and worked as a reporter for the Lafayette Call. In 1890, Ade was hired on by the Chicago Morning News (later known as the Chicago Record), where McCutcheon was working. He wrote the column, Stories of the Streets and of the Town. In the column, which McCutcheon illustrated, Ade illustrated Chicago-life. It featured characters like Artie, an office boy, Doc Horne, a gentlemanly liar, and Pink Marsh, a black shoeshine boy. Ade's well-known Fables in Slang was introduced in the popular column.Ade's literary reputation rests upon his achievements as a great humorist of American character during an important era in American history. The 1890's marked the first large migration from the countryside to burgeoning cities like Chicago, where, in fact, Ade produced his best fiction. He was a practicing realist during the Age of (William Dean) Howells and a local colorist of Chicago and the Midwest. His work constitutes a vast comedy of Midwestern manners and, indeed, a comedy of late 19th century American manners.Ade's fiction dealt consistently with the little man, the common, undistinguished, average American, usually a farmer or lower middle class citizen (he sometimes skewered women too, especially women with laughable social pretensions).Ade's followed in the footsteps of his idol Mark Twain by making expert use of the American language. In his unique Fables in Slang, (1899) which purveyed not so much slang as the American colloquial vernacular, Ade pursued an effectively genial satire notable for its scrupulous objectivity. Ade's regular practice in the best fables is to present a little drama incorporating concrete, specific evidence with which he implicitly indicts the object of his satire-- always a type (e.g., the social climber). The fable's actual moral is nearly always implicit, though he liked to tack on a mock, often ironic moral (e.g., Industry and perseverance bring a sure reward).As a moralist who does not overtly moralize, who is all too aware of the ironies of what in his day was the modern world, George Ade was perhaps our first modern American humorist, paving the way for people such as Will Rogers to follow. The United States, in Ade's lifetime, underwent a great population shift and transfer from an agricultural to an industrial economy. Many felt the nation suffered the even more agonizing process of shifting values toward philistinism, greed, and dishonesty. Ade's prevalent practice is to record the pragmatic efforts of the little man to get along in such a world.Ade was a playwright (see Other Works) as well as an author, penning such stage works as Artie, The Sultan of Sulu (a musical comedy), The College Widow, The Fair Co-ed, and The County Chairman. He wrote the first American play about football.After twelve years in Chicago, he built a home near the town of Brook, Indiana (Newton County). It soon became known for hosting a campaign stop in 1908 by William Howard Taft, a rally for Theodore Roosevelt's Bull Moose Party in 1912, and a homecoming for returning soldiers and sailors in 1919.George Ade is one of the American writers whose publications made him rich. When land values were inflated about the time of World War I, Ade was a millionaire. The Ross-Ade football stadium at Purdue University was built with his (and David E. Ross's) financial support. He also generously supported his college fraternity, Sigma Chi, leading a fund-raising campaign to endow the Sigma Chi mother house at the site of the fraternity's original establishment at Miami University. Ade is also famous among Sigma Chis as the author of The Sigma Chi Creed, written in 1929, one of the central documents of the fraternity's philosophies.While Ade's writings fell out of public favor as America struggled through the Great Depression and the onslaught of World War II, his legacy lives on. Ade populated his writings with comedic characters lifted from the streets and front porches of small Midwestern towns and peppered the language with witty slang characters and situations that can still be found in movies and television sitcoms. Ade's comedic style is just as popular today as it was when he introduced it over a hundred years ago. While Ade was never considered a high-brow literary writer or a fashionably caustic social critic, he succeeded in what he had set out to do, he made America laugh."",""February 7, 1866 inÂ Kentland, Indiana, USA"",""1866-02-07"",""Kentland, Indiana, USA"",""May 16, 1944 inÂ Brook, Indiana, USA Â (heart attack)"",""16.05.1944"",""Brook, Indiana, USA Â "",""heart attack"",,""0"",""0"",""0"",""0"""

As of 2001 she co-founded, together with Janine Jackowski, a fellow graduate from HFF, the Komplizen film company. It is through Komplizen that Maren would later co-produce, among others, Arabian Nights, Miguel Gomes' masterpiece. After two shorts in 2000 and 2001 made under the auspices of her film school, she co-produced, wrote and and directed Der Wald vor lauter BĂ¤umen (2003), her first feature. A grueling drama about the difficult beginnings of a new teacher, the movie impressed both audiences and critics. Incidentally, it is of interest to specify that its school scenes were entirely shot within the walls of the educational institution where her mother was teaching at the time. This promising effort was followed six years later by Alle Anderen (2009), which although taking place in a totally different setting (the Sardinian seaside in the glory of Summer) also concerns characters unsure of themselves. A taut drama as well, it revolves around two holiday making newly married couples and describes in a Roman Polanski-like manner the wicked relationships they share. But her greatest success came in 2015 and 2016 with Vi Presento Toni Erdmann (2016), an offbeat comedy with a philosophical approach, which enthused the festival-goers at Cannes, allegedly making them roar with laughter, and later making unexpected profit in art houses throughout the world.

Along with his elder brother Craig, he was raised by their parents, John and Janet (Sanders) Adkins, in a loving middle-class family. Scott attended Bishop Vesey's Grammar School in Sutton Coldfield. Probably not the best of students, he used to sneak downstairs after his parents had gone to bed and watch films all night then fall asleep during lessons. A natural athlete, Scott enjoyed a variety of sports as he grew up, but when he was 10 years old, he accompanied his father and brother to the local Judo club. The attraction was instantaneous. Idolising stars such as Bruce Lee and Jean-Claude Van Damme, Scott began to train everyday. He took over his Dad's garage and turned it into his own Dojo. He even had a shrine to Bruce Lee in there that he would bow to. He remembers being mugged on a bus when he was around 13 and that really kicked his training into overdrive. He wasn't ever going to let that happen again. At the age of 14, Scott went on to train in Tae Kwon Do under the instruction of Ron Sergiew with the T.A.G.B. After a few years, he moved on to Kickboxing under Anthony Jones. He is now a fully trained Kickboxing Instructor for the P. K. A. A self confessed film junkie Scott's attention was drawn to acting through the Hollywood Greats. He enrolled in a drama class at Sutton Coldfield College. Being a shy lad he initially found it difficult to be put on stage in front of an audience. Finally, at the age of 21, Scott was offered a place at the prestigious Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art. However, as an impoverished student, he found it hard to make ends meet without a grant and was forced to leave without completing the course. Very dejected he thought that was the end.His first break came when he was offered a role in a Hong Kong martial arts film called Dei seung chui keung (2001) (aka Extreme Challenge). Spotted by Head of The Hong Kong Stuntmen Association and director Wei Tung and English-born Hong Kong movie expert Bey Logan, Adkins found himself in the East for the first time. Scott got the chance to work with some of Hong Kong cinema's leading action directors including Woo-Ping Yuen, Corey Yuen, Sammo Kam-Bo Hung and the legendary Jackie Chan. Acting roles started to come in and he was offered a guest role in BBC's Doctors (2000) filmed at Birmingham's Pebble Mill. A few episodes in BBC's EastEnders (1985) and City Central (1998), and a lead role in Sky One comedy drama Mile High (2003) followed by a regular role in BBC's Holby City (1999) as Bradley Hume, the assistant General Manager of Holby General.Starring roles in feature films soon followed with his portrayal of Talbot in Special Forces (2003) and Yuri Boyka in Undisputed II: Last Man Standing (2006). It was this film that broke him into the mainstream with his villainous portrayal of a Russian MMA underground fighter Boyka in what has been hailed as one of the best American made Martial Arts films of recent times. Along with lead actor Michael Jai White, fight coordinator J.J. Perry and the slick direction of Isaac Florentine this movie has some unbelievably heart stopping fight scenes. After this Scott has had guest starring roles in bigger budget films like The Bourne Ultimatum - Il ritorno dello sciacallo (2007) and The Tournament (2009), and played Jean-Claude Van Damme's main adversary in Sony Pictures The Shepherd - Pattuglia di confine (2008)."",""June 17, 1976 inÂ Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, England, UK"",""17.06.1976"",""Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, England, UK"",,,,,""Lisa  (? - present)"",""1"",""0"",""0"",""0"""

Narrations: HBO's Real Sex (and numerous documentaries), Discovery Channel, PBS and American Masters. Cynthia's voice was also heard on The Coneheads cartoon, Marilyn in Manhattan TV doc, Brain Games television series, and as series narrator for America Undercover.As the voice of numerous national commercials - Revlon, Mercedes Benz, Pampers, McDonalds, Estee Lauder, Delta Airlines, and the voice of Chiquita Banana (just to name a few) - her original poem My Face, along with her voice, was chosen for a national ad campaign for Oil of Olay that ran for nearly two years.So yes, Cynthia's been behind the mike for much of her career. But she's a Gemini... and they fly to many different destinations before the wings explode.Her cabaret acts (where she performed many crazy parodies about the environment, corporate takeovers, and plastic surgery) were a huge success. These shows paved the way into what eventually evolved into a nine-character, one woman show, Downloaded...and in Denial, which got rave reviews in New York and the Northeast, was featured as a half-page article in The New York Times, by Chris Hedges, and was voted Best Show of the Year, at the Big Arts Festival in Sanibel, Florida.As a teenager, Cynthia contributed to Mad Magazine (much of it too inflammatory to print) and later, became a writer and Contributing Editor for Status Celebrity, and Film International Magazines, all of which went defunct much too soon (no... not her fault!). She was then recruited (because of her comedy writing) by some powerful Ad Agencies in New York to write copy for many of their TV commercials.She also spent a lot of time hanging out inside someone's mouth, as she dubbed leading roles in numerous foreign films (such as Swept Away and Seven Beauties, for Lina Wertmueller, 1900 for Bernardo Bertolucci, and Scenes From a Marriage, for Ingmar Bergman). Some of her on-screen credits include Che Cosa? for Italian Television, Hangin' Out With Ceci for ABC Afterschool Special, George Romero's Knightriders, and Bananas Is My Business, on PBS.Trained by Jim Henson and Frank Oz, she went to London to do the Muppet Shows.

"nm0012204,""Luther Adler"",""Lutha Adler"",""170"",""The actor and Broadway director Luther Adler was born into a Yiddish theatrical dynasty. One of the six children born to Jacob P. and Sara Adler, he made his debut in the world in New York City on May 4, 1903, originally billed as Lutha J. Adler. His full siblings Charles, Jay, Julia, and Stella (the famous acting teacher) as well as his half-siblings Celia and Abram Adler all appeared on Broadway, and his father Jacob, the biggest star of the Yiddish-language theater, was considered one of the great American actors.The Yiddish theater was an important cultural venue in the days when the millions of Jewish immigrants in the greater metropolitan New York area spoke Yiddish as their first (and sometimes only) language. People who trained and appeared in the Yiddish theater were instrumental in the development of the modern American theater and film, and some, including Sidney Lumet, are still active in the 21st century. It was in this cultural milieu that Luther and his siblings got their grounding in acting and the theater.Jacob Adler owned and operated his own stage in New York's Lower East Side, and Luther began appearing in the family productions at the age of five with the Adler production of Schmendrick. He made his official debut as an actor at the age of 13 at his father's theater and his Broadway debut at the the age of 18. Billed as Lutha Adler, he appeared in the Provincetown Players' production of Theodore Drieser's The Hand of the Potter in December 1921 at the Provincetown Playhouse,Adler's first Broadway hit was Humoresque in 1923, and he appeared regularly in top productions throughout the '20s, including Street Scene (1929) and Red Dust (1929). Along with his sister 'Stella Adler, Luther Adler was one of the original members of the Group Theatre acting company, which was formed in 1931 by Harold Clurman (his future brother-in-law), Cheryl Crawford, and Lee Strasberg. Others who would make their bones in the company were Elia Kazan, Julius John Garfield, Howard Da Silva, Franchot Tone, John Randolph, Will Geer, Clifford Odets and Lee J. Cobb.The Group Theatre was dedicated to bringing realism to the American stage and was instrumental in introducing the Stanislavsky technique into American acting. Most members were leftists if not communists, and the collective wanted to produce plays dealing with social issues. For the Groupe Theatre, Adler appeared in Night Over Taos (1932), Success Story (1933), Alien Corn (1933) and two seminal works of the American stage written by Odets: Awake and Sing! (1935) and Golden Boy (1937). He played opposite leading ladies Katharine Cornell in Alien Corn (1933), his sister Stella in Gold Eagle Guy (1934), Awake and Sing! and Paradise Lost (both 1935), and Frances Farmer in Golden Boy (1937).His appearance as the urban ethnic boxer Joe Bonaparte in Odets' Golden Boy arguably was his greatest role, but when the film was made in 1939, he was passed over for the improbably cast Wlliam Holden, a white-bread WASP. Although Adler appeared in many motion pictures, his reputation would remain primarily that of a stage actor.Adler became a director on Broadway in 1942, though his first staging, They Should Have Stayed in Bed, was a flop, lasting but 11 performances. He next directed Ben Hecht's pro-Israel propaganda play A Flag is Born in 1946, starring the great Paul Muni, a graduate of the Yiddish theater, and newcomer Marlon Brando, an Irish-American born-Protestant who had been trained by his sister Stella. The play, which raised money for Jewsh refugees from the Holocaust seeking sanctuary in Palestine, was a hit, running for 120 performances. He also directed Angel Street (1955) and A View from the Bridge (1960). He last appeared on Broadway as a replacement in the long running Fiddler on the Roof.Adler made his movie debut in 1937 with Lancer Spy, but he never became a star in that medium. His best roles like Golden Boy and Humoresque were taken by other actors, including Group Theatre alumnus John Garfield. He had memorable supporting turns in the noir classic D.O.A. (1950), in Joseph Losey's remake of M (1951), in Paul Muni's last film The Last Angry Man (1959), in the Holocaust drama The Man in the Glass Booth (1974), and as Paul Newman's mobster uncle in Absence of Malice (1981). He also worked frequently on television.From 1938 until 1947, Adler was married to the actress Sylvia Sidney. They had one child, a son, Jacob.
